# Analysis of Paper 134

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** ALANCA: Active Learning Guided Adversarial Attacks for Code Comprehension on Diverse Pre-trained and Large Language Models
- **Authors:** Dexin Liu, Shikun Zhang
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:15†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces ALANCA, an active-learning guided adversarial attack framework designed to assess the robustness of neural code models across various code comprehension tasks, including clone detection. The framework employs semantic-preserving transformations and adaptive adversarial techniques to generate adversarial examples that challenge the models' robustness. The study evaluates ALANCA's effectiveness on multiple pre-trained models and large language models, demonstrating high attack success rates and adaptability. The authors conclude that ALANCA provides a comprehensive tool for probing the vulnerabilities of neural code models, highlighting the need for improved robustness in AI-assisted software development【4:15†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses several datasets for evaluation, including CodeSearchNet for code summarization, Java-med for method name prediction, JAVA250 for code classification, and BigCloneBench for code clone detection【4:1†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel framework for adversarial attacks rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we introduce ALANCA, an active-learning guided adversarial attack framework tailored for neural code models."【4:15†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces ALANCA, a new framework for adversarial attacks on code comprehension models, including clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We propose ALANCA, an active-learning guided adversarial attack framework for neural code models."【4:16†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as a dataset for evaluating the clone detection task.
  - **Quote:** "For the Clone Detection task, we used the BigCloneBench dataset."【4:1†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "For the Clone Detection task, we used the BigCloneBench dataset."【4:1†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The version is not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "For the Clone Detection task, we used the BigCloneBench dataset."【4:1†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions filtering code snippets that lack function parameters, variable declarations, and methods containing fewer than five lines.
  - **Quote:** "We excluded code snippets that lacked function parameters, variable declarations, and methods containing fewer than five lines before conducting our experiments."【4:1†134_10.1109_SANER60148.2024.00067.pdf】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on the exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes, extensions, or enrichment to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's reliability could be compromised, affecting the conclusions drawn about the robustness of the models. This would also impact the generalizability of the findings, as the evaluation might not accurately reflect the models' performance on true clone pairs.
