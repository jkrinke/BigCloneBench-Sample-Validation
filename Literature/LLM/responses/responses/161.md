# Analysis of Paper 161

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Gitor: Scalable Code Clone Detection by Building Global Sample Graph
- **Authors:** Junjie Shan, Shihan Dou, Yueming Wu, Hairu Wu, Yang Liu
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:0†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces Gitor, a novel method for scalable code clone detection that constructs a global sample graph to capture connections among code samples. The methodology involves tokenizing code samples to extract individual information, building a global graph, and applying node embedding to detect clone pairs. The study evaluates Gitor using the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrating its superior accuracy and execution time compared to existing tools. The paper concludes that Gitor effectively enhances clone detection performance, especially when combined with traditional vector-based methods【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is a widely recognized dataset in the field of code clone detection【4:1†source】【4:10†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel code clone detection method leveraging global graph built across code samples"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces Gitor, a new method for code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel code clone detection method leveraging global graph built across code samples"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates Gitor using the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We implement a prototype system, Gitor, and evaluate it on a widely used dataset, namely BigCloneBench"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "Gitor is not a deep learning-based method"【4:6†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using over 8 million clone pairs, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "The total number of these clone pairs used in our experiments is 8,446,574"【4:11†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify any filtering or modification of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "8,424,068 WT3/T4 clones"【4:11†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the full dataset as provided.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The inclusion of WT3/T4 pairs, which are largely not clones, could affect the reported accuracy and effectiveness of Gitor.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology's reliance on potentially inaccurate data could lead to overestimated performance metrics. The conclusions about Gitor's effectiveness might be less reliable, and the generalizability of the results could be compromised if the dataset's integrity is questioned.

**Note:**  
- **Q L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones potentially weakens the claims about Gitor's effectiveness, as these pairs were included in the evaluation.
