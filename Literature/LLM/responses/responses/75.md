# Analysis of Paper 75

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** On the Use of Machine Learning Techniques Towards the Design of Cloud Based Automatic Code Clone Validation Tools
- **Authors:** Golam Mostaeen, Jeffrey Svajlenko, Banani Roy, Chanchal K. Roy, Kevin Schneider
- **Publication Year:** 2018【4:0†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to automate the validation of code clones, which traditionally requires manual effort and is prone to errors. The methodology involves training machine learning models on manually validated code clone sets to predict user-specific validation patterns. The study evaluates the proposed system using various clone detection tools and open-source projects, achieving an accuracy of up to 87.4%. The findings suggest that the approach can significantly reduce the manual effort required for clone validation and improve the precision of clone detection tools. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential for scaling the method for large-scale code clone management【4:1†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses clones from IJaDataset 2.0, a large inter-project dataset of open-source Java systems, for training the machine learning model. It also mentions using BigCloneBench to create artificial true positive code clone pairs【4:3†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to create artificial clones, not directly as ground truth for training.
  - **Quote:** "We used different original code fragments from BigCloneBench to create 3750 such artificial true positive code clone pairs"【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench was used.
  - **Quote:** The paper only mentions "BigCloneBench" without specifying a version【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it was modified to create artificial clones.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses fragments from BigCloneBench to create artificial clones.
  - **Quote:** "We used different original code fragments from BigCloneBench to create 3750 such artificial true positive code clone pairs"【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention the WT3/T4 subset specifically.
  - **Quote:** No specific mention of WT3/T4 subset【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Yes, it was used to create artificial clones.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench fragments to create artificial clones for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We used different original code fragments from BigCloneBench to create 3750 such artificial true positive code clone pairs"【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** No mention of using a subset from previous work【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention validating or investigating BigCloneBench’s ground truth.

  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** No citation of "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of using BigCloneBench fragments to create artificial clones, as the reliability of the source data is questionable.
  - **Impact on Methodology:** The methodology of using BigCloneBench to create artificial clones might be compromised if the source data is unreliable.
  - **Impact on Conclusions:** The conclusions about the effectiveness of the machine learning model might be affected if the training data is not representative of true clones.
  - **Impact on Generalizability:** The generalizability of the findings could be limited if the artificial clones do not accurately represent real-world clone scenarios【4:6†75_10.1109_SCAM.2018.00025.pdf】.
