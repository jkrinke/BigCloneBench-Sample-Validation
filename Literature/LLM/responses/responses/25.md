# Analysis of Paper 25

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** TECCD: A Tree Embedding Approach for Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Yi Gao, Zan Wang, Shuang Liu, Lin Yang, Wei Sang, Yuanfang Cai
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:2†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces TECCD, a novel tree embedding approach for code clone detection, which aims to improve the accuracy and recall of clone detection by leveraging the structural information of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The methodology involves embedding AST nodes into vectors and composing tree vectors to measure Euclidean distances for clone detection. The study evaluates TECCD using BigCloneBench and seven other large-scale Java projects, demonstrating that TECCD outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and recall. The authors conclude that their approach is effective and efficient for detecting Type-3 clones【4:2†source】【4:17†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench and seven other large-scale Java projects for evaluation. The datasets include JDK 1.2.2, OpenNLP 1.8.1, Maven 3.5.0, Ant 1.10.1, Commons Lang 3-3.7, and jEdit 5.4.0【4:4†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we introduce a tree embedding technique to conduct clone detection."【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method called TECCD.
  - **Quote:** "We implement our approach in a tool called TECCD and conduct an evaluation..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the datasets for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We implement our approach in a tool called TECCD and conduct an evaluation using the BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training purposes.
  - **Quote:** "Evaluation with the BigCloneBench The BigCloneBench has known label deficiencies..."【4:16†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a dataset with over 8 million clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench [63] 32, 317 8, 836, 676 168, 965"【4:4†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, partially.
  - **Explanation:** The evaluation is conducted on a partially labeled set.
  - **Quote:** "The evaluation results on BigCloneBench is conducted on a partially labelled set..."【4:16†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions cross-validation by students.
  - **Quote:** "We ask two master students to cross validate the results to decrease the potential risks."【4:16†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could affect the validity of the results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This could affect the methodology and conclusions, particularly the reported accuracy and recall, as the evaluation might have been based on incorrect ground truth data. The generalizability of the results could be compromised if the dataset's integrity is questioned.

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
