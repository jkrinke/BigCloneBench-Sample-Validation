# Analysis of Paper 26

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Java Code Clone Detection by Exploiting Semantic and Syntax Information From Intermediate Code-Based Graph
- **Authors:** Dawei Yuan, Sen Fang, Tao Zhang, Zhou Xu, and Xiapu Luo
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:0†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel approach for detecting Java code clones by leveraging semantic and syntactic information extracted from intermediate code-based graphs. The authors propose a method that constructs a graph representation from intermediate code, which includes abstract syntax trees (AST), control flow graphs (CFG), and data flow graphs (DFG). This representation is used to enhance clone detection by applying graph embedding techniques and a Softmax classifier. The study evaluates the approach using the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods, particularly in detecting type-4 clones. The authors conclude that their method significantly improves clone detection accuracy by effectively capturing both syntactic and semantic features【4:0†source】【4:6†source】【4:13†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation. It specifically mentions using the dataset to assess the performance of their proposed intermediate code-based graph approach for code clone detection【4:0†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is not a systematic literature review or a survey; it presents a novel approach for code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this article, we develop a novel graph representation approach based on intermediate code to detect the functional code clones"【4:0†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach for code clone detection using intermediate code-based graphs.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a new approach to identify functional clone code by analyzing the source code at the level of the intermediate code"【4:13†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the performance of their proposed approach.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluate the performance of the proposed graph representation approach based on intermediate code for the code clone detection task on the BigCloneBench dataset"【4:0†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train the Softmax classifier as part of the evaluation process.
  - **Quote:** "We divide the dataset into two parts, 80% for training Softmax classifier and 20% for testing and evaluating the performance of the code clone detection approaches"【4:4†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a dataset with 6 million true clone pairs and 260,000 false clone pairs, which corresponds to the old version.
  - **Quote:** "This dataset covers ten functionalities programs, including 6 000 000 true clone pairs and 260 000 false clone pairs"【4:4†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was filtered to remove code pairs without any tag, resulting in 9,134 code fragments.
  - **Quote:** "We discard code pairs without any tag and use the remaining 9134 code fragments"【4:4†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide specific information about the exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes, extensions, or enrichment to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's accuracy and the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the proposed approach could be compromised. The generalizability of the results might be affected, as the dataset's reliability is questioned. Further investigation would be needed to assess the extent of this impact.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 26, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, No, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- For question G, the paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- For question L, the finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not provide specific information on this aspect.
