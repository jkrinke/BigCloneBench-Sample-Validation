# Analysis of Paper 501

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Supervised Deep Features for Software Functional Clone Detection by Exploiting Lexical and Syntactical Information in Source Code
- **Authors:** Hui-Hui Wei and Ming Li
- **Publication Year:** 2017【4:7†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper addresses the challenge of software functional clone detection, particularly Type-4 clones, by proposing a novel approach called CDLH (Clone Detection with Learning to Hash). The authors formulate clone detection as a supervised learning problem, using pairwise labels to guide the learning of deep features that capture functional similarities between code fragments. The methodology involves an end-to-end framework that integrates representation extraction using AST-based LSTM and hashing techniques to improve detection efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that CDLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting functional clones, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging lexical and syntactical information【4:0†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】【4:11†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench and OJClone. BigCloneBench is a widely used benchmark for clone detection, consisting of Java code fragments, while OJClone is derived from a pedagogical programming open judge system with C code fragments【4:4†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we address software functional clone detection, i.e., Type-4 clone detection, by learning supervised deep features"【4:0†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces CDLH, a new framework for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We propose CDLH, an end-to-end deep feature learning framework"【4:0†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the datasets for evaluating the proposed method.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct our experiments on two real-world datasets... BigCloneBench"【4:4†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset provides pairwise labels used for supervised learning.
  - **Quote:** "We formulate clone detection as a supervised deep learning problem by introducing pairwise labels"【4:5†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions 10 functionalities, consistent with the old version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench consists of projects from 25,000 systems, covers 10 functionalities"【4:4†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of 9,134 code fragments.
  - **Quote:** "We discard code fragments without any tagged true and false clone pairs, and use the remaining 9,134 code fragments"【4:4†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The subset used is filtered by the authors themselves.
  - **Quote:** "We discard code fragments without any tagged true and false clone pairs"【4:4†501_Supervised_2017.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of the results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subset was included, the methodology's reliance on BigCloneBench as a ground truth could be compromised, affecting the conclusions about the effectiveness of CDLH. The generalizability of the results might be questioned if the dataset's integrity is in doubt. However, without explicit mention of WT3/T4, the exact impact is uncertain.

# Summary

```
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 501, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, No, No, No, Potentially

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded, hence "Not specified."
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation, hence "Potentially."
