# Analysis of Paper 11

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Detecting Code Clones with Graph Neural Network and Flow-Augmented Abstract Syntax Tree
- **Authors:** Wenhan Wang, Ge Li, Bo Ma, Xin Xia, Zhi Jin
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:3†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a novel approach for detecting code clones using graph neural networks (GNN) and a flow-augmented abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). The methodology involves constructing FA-ASTs by augmenting ASTs with control and data flow edges, and then applying GNNs to measure code similarity. The study evaluates this approach on two datasets, Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods, particularly in detecting semantic clones. The authors conclude that their approach effectively captures both syntactic and semantic information, enhancing clone detection capabilities【4:0†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】【4:1†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages explicit control and data flow information for code clone detection."【4:1†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is one of the datasets used for evaluating the proposed approach.
  - **Quote:** "We apply our FA-AST and graph neural networks on two Java datasets: Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench."【4:3†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train and evaluate the proposed GNN-based approach.
  - **Quote:** "For the BigCloneBench dataset, we use the same 9,134 code fragments from [3]."【4:2†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using 10 functionalities, which corresponds to the old version.
  - **Quote:** "The second dataset BigCloneBench is a widely used large code clone benchmark that contains over 6,000,000 true clone pairs and 260,000 false clone pairs from 10 different functionalities."【4:17†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of 9,134 code fragments.
  - **Quote:** "For the BigCloneBench dataset, we use the same 9,134 code fragments from [3]."【4:2†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was not excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates on WT3/T4 clones.
  - **Quote:** "When comparing our approach with ASTNN, we can see that our approach outperforms ASTNN in the WT3/T4 semantic clones which we concern most."【4:4†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The subset of 9,134 code fragments is from previous work.
  - **Quote:** "For the BigCloneBench dataset, we use the same 9,134 code fragments from [3]."【4:2†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:13†11_10.1109_SANER48275.2020.9054857.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The paper's evaluation on WT3/T4 clones, which are now known to be largely incorrect, could affect the validity of the results.
  - **Impact:** The methodology and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the approach on semantic clones (WT3/T4) are particularly affected. The generalizability of the findings may be compromised due to reliance on potentially flawed data.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 11, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Yes, No, No, Yes, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- **F:** The paper uses a filtered subset of 9,134 code fragments from BigCloneBench.
- **G:** The WT3/T4 subset was included in the evaluation, which is significant given the recent findings about its inaccuracies.
- **L:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones potentially weakens the paper's claims regarding the effectiveness of their approach on semantic clones.
