# Analysis of Paper 61

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** SCDetector: Software Functional Clone Detection Based on Semantic Tokens Analysis
- **Authors:** Yueming Wu, Deqing Zou, Shihan Dou, Siru Yang, Wei Yang, Feng Cheng, Hong Liang, and Hai Jin
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:18†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces SCDetector, a novel method for detecting semantic code clones by combining token-based scalability with graph-based accuracy. The approach involves transforming control flow graphs (CFGs) into semantic tokens using social network centrality analysis, which are then processed by a Siamese network to detect clone pairs. The study evaluates SCDetector on the Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench datasets, demonstrating superior performance over four state-of-the-art clone detectors. The results highlight SCDetector's ability to maintain high accuracy while being significantly faster than traditional graph-based methods【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench. The BigCloneBench dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of SCDetector in detecting semantic clones【4:1†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method for clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel method to measure the similarity of semantic codes, namely SCDetector"【4:9†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces SCDetector, a new method for detecting semantic code clones.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel method to combine the scalability of token-based techniques with the accuracy of graph-based approaches to detect semantic code clones"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is one of the datasets used to evaluate SCDetector.
  - **Quote:** "We implement a prototype system, SCDetector, and evaluate it on two widely used datasets, namely Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluate SCDetector on two widely used datasets and experimental results show that SCDetector is superior to other four state-of-the-art clone detectors"【4:9†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using over 6,000,000 tagged clone pairs, which corresponds to the old version.
  - **Quote:** "The second dataset used in our experiment is BigCloneBench dataset, which composes of over 6,000,000 tagged clone pairs"【4:4†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a subset of 0.28 million code pairs from BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "In our experiments, the number of used code pairs are about 1.4 million and 0.28 million in Google Code Jam dataset and BigCloneBench dataset, respectively"【4:1†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was not excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "The total number of similar and dissimilar method pairs are 275,570 and 1,116,376, respectively"【4:4†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions manual examination of clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "To find out the reason why SCDetector performs better on BigCloneBench dataset, we manually examine several Type-4 clone pairs"【4:10†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:8†source】【4:11†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of SCDetector's evaluation results, particularly for Type-4 clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relies on the accuracy of BigCloneBench's ground truth. If a large portion of the dataset is incorrect, the conclusions about SCDetector's effectiveness, especially in detecting semantic clones, may be overstated. This affects the generalizability of the results, as the evaluation may not accurately reflect real-world performance.
