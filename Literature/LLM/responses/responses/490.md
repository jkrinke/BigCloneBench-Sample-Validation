# Analysis of Paper 490

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** DroidSD: An Efficient Indexed Based Android Applications Similarity Detection Tool
- **Authors:** Junaid Akram, Zhendong Shi, Majid Mumtaz, and Ping Luo
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:1†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents DroidSD, a novel tool for detecting code clones in Android applications at the source code level. The authors employ reverse engineering to decompile APK files and preprocess the source code for clone detection. DroidSD is capable of identifying Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 clones with high accuracy, leveraging a fast and reliable indexing method. The tool is evaluated using real-time datasets, including BigCloneBench, demonstrating significant recall and precision in clone detection. The study concludes with plans to extend the tool for detecting Type-4 clones and enhancing security measures against malicious code【4:1†source】【4:4†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench and IJaDataset for evaluation. BigCloneBench is specifically mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the recall of DroidSD【4:6†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose and design DroidSD, a clone detection tool for Android applications"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces DroidSD, a new tool for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we have proposed DroidSD a novel approach for clone detection in Android applications at source code level"【4:4†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the recall of DroidSD.
  - **Quote:** "We executed DroidSD for IJaDataset and evaluated Recall with BigCloneBench"【4:12†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions "almost 8 million validated clone pairs," which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench was built on the basis of IJaDataset and consists of almost 8 million validated clone pairs"【4:12†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify any filtering or modification of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No exclusion is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention excluding any subsets from BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as is for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of DroidSD's evaluation results, especially if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 pairs were part of the evaluation, the recall and precision metrics reported could be inflated, affecting the perceived accuracy and reliability of DroidSD. This could lead to questioning the generalizability of the tool's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The paper's conclusions about DroidSD's high accuracy might need reevaluation in light of these findings.

# Summary

Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 490, No, Yes, Yes, No, New, No, No, No, No, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- **L (Potentially):** The recent finding regarding the WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench could potentially weaken the claims about DroidSD's accuracy if these pairs were included in the evaluation. This could affect the reported recall and precision metrics.
