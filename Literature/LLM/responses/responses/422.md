# Analysis of Paper 422

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Finding Code-Clone Snippets in Large Source-Code Collection by ccgrep
- **Authors:** Katsuro Inoue, Yuya Miyamoto, Daniel M. German, Takashi Ishio
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:0†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces **ccgrep**, a token-based pattern matching tool designed to find code snippets using the concept of code clone pairs. The tool allows users to input a code snippet as a query and specify the target source code to retrieve matched code snippets. The methodology involves using meta-tokens to enhance query precision, and the tool is evaluated for its expressiveness, accuracy, and performance. Key findings indicate that ccgrep effectively finds intended code snippets in large open-source software collections, demonstrating high scalability and performance. The paper concludes that ccgrep is a practical tool for software engineers, with potential for further performance improvements【4:0†source】【4:5†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses **BigCloneBench** for evaluation, specifically extracting all pairs classified as type 1 and type 2 code clones to test the accuracy of ccgrep【4:6†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a tool and its evaluation rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose ccgrep, a token-based pattern matching tool with the notion of code clone pairs."【4:0†source】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces ccgrep, a new tool for finding code snippets.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose ccgrep, a token-based pattern matching tool with the notion of code clone pairs."【4:0†source】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the accuracy of ccgrep.
  - **Quote:** "For this purpose, first, we have employed BigCloneBench which is a huge collection of various kinds of code clones."【4:6†source】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "For this purpose, first, we have employed BigCloneBench which is a huge collection of various kinds of code clones."【4:6†source】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using BigCloneBench but does not specify whether it is the old or new version.
  - **Quote:** "For this purpose, first, we have employed BigCloneBench which is a huge collection of various kinds of code clones."【4:6†source】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper extracts type 1 and type 2 clones for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We have extracted all pairs classified as type 1 and type 2 code clones from BigCloneBench."【4:6†source】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention WT3/T4 specifically.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as is for evaluation purposes.
  - **Quote:** "We have extracted all pairs classified as type 1 and type 2 code clones from BigCloneBench."【4:6†source】

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper extracts its own subset from BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "We have extracted all pairs classified as type 1 and type 2 code clones from BigCloneBench."【4:6†source】

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper investigates cases where clones were not found and attributes them to classification faults in BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "There were several cases of not-found clones, and we have investigated further those cases and recognized that those cases are faults of the classification of BigCloneBench."【4:6†source】

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the evaluation results if these pairs were included in the evaluation subset.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the accuracy claims of ccgrep might be overstated, affecting the tool's perceived reliability. The methodology might need revision to exclude these pairs, and conclusions about the tool's effectiveness could be less generalizable if based on flawed data. However, since the paper does not specify using WT3/T4, the direct impact is uncertain.

# Summary

Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 422, No, Yes, Yes, No, Not specified, Yes, Not specified, No, No, Yes, No, Potentially

**Note:**  
- **E:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench was used.
- **G:** The paper does not mention the WT3/T4 subset specifically.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation subset. However, the paper does not specify using WT3/T4, so the direct impact is uncertain.
