# Analysis of Paper 39

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Finding Source Code Clones in Intermediate Representations of Java Bytecode
- **Authors:** André Schäfer, Thomas S. Heinze, Wolfram Amme
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:1†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel technique for detecting source code clones in Java Bytecode by extending the StoneDetector system, which originally works on Java source code. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this approach using BigCloneBench, a state-of-the-art benchmark for clone detection. The authors compare the performance of clone detection in stack-based and register-based Bytecode representations, finding that the register-based representation is more effective. The results indicate that the extended system can detect source code clones in Java Bytecode with high recall and precision, offering a competitive alternative when source code is unavailable【4:1†source】【4:4†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench as the primary dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of the clone detection technique. It specifically mentions using a reduced version of BigCloneBench, which includes 52,816 source files and 7.9 million clone pairs, due to the limitations in compiling Bytecode【4:18†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel technique for clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we have presented a new technique for detecting source code clones in Java Bytecode"【4:11†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper extends the StoneDetector system to work on Java Bytecode.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we extend the source-code based clone detector StoneDetector to Java Bytecode"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the benchmark for evaluating the clone detection technique.
  - **Quote:** "Using BigCloneBench as state-of-the-art benchmark, we are able to assess and analyze its effectiveness"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using 7.9 million clone pairs, which aligns with the new version.
  - **Quote:** "The generated Bytecode comprises 7.9 million or 92.5% of the benchmark’s 8.5 million clone pairs"【4:18†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of BigCloneBench due to Bytecode compilation limitations.
  - **Quote:** "Using Stubber, we are able to generate Bytecode for 52,816 or 95% of the overall 55,499 Java source files in BigCloneBench"【4:18†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was excluded.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The subset was created by the authors using the Stubber tool.
  - **Quote:** "Using Stubber, we are able to generate Bytecode for 52,816 or 95% of the overall 55,499 Java source files in BigCloneBench"【4:18†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions manual validation of detected clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "A random sample of 400 detected clone pairs has been chosen for each clone detector individually and has been manually validated"【4:15†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was part of the subset used.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's accuracy and the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the clone detection technique could be compromised. The generalizability of the results might be affected, as the presence of non-clone pairs could lead to inflated recall and precision metrics.

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
