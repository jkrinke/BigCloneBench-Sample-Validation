# Analysis of Paper 36

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** A Novel Method for Code Clone Detection Based on Minimally Random Kernel Convolutional Transform
- **Authors:** Mostefai Abdelkader
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:3†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel approach for code clone detection using the Minimally Random Kernel Convolutional Transform (MiniRocket), originally designed for time series classification. The study aims to adapt this technique to software engineering, specifically for detecting code clones. The methodology involves transforming code pairs into time series data, representing them as feature vectors, and training classifiers like XGBoost and Random Forest to identify clones. The empirical study, conducted on the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrates the method's effectiveness in detecting various clone types, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art tools. The paper concludes that the proposed method has significant potential for improving clone detection capabilities【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is a Java-based, function-level dataset composed of more than 8,000,000 tagged clone pairs【4:4†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method for code clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages minimally random kernel convolutional transform (MiniRocket) to represent source code for clone detection"【4:3†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper proposes a new method using MiniRocket for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Novel Methodology: We propose a novel method based on MiniRocket to compute a representation for code pairs"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the proposed method.
  - **Quote:** "Experimental results on the well-known BigCloneBench (BCB) dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively detects Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV clones"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train classifiers to determine clone status.
  - **Quote:** "The proposed approach consists of three steps: ... (3) training a classifier such as XGBoost and Random Forest on this dataset to determine whether two new code fragments are clones"【4:1†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is described as having more than 8,000,000 tagged clone pairs, which aligns with the new version.
  - **Quote:** "It is a Java-based, function-level dataset composed of more than 8,000,000 tagged clone pairs"【4:4†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been sampled.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions sampling from the BCB dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We used the dataset provided by [30] and sampled from the BCB dataset"【4:4†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, WT3/T4 was included.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset includes WT3/T4 clones as part of the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "Weakly Type-3/Type-4(WT3/T4): Similarity between [0.0, 0.5)"【4:4†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no indication of changes beyond sampling.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a dataset provided by previous work.
  - **Quote:** "We used the dataset provided by [30] and sampled from the BCB dataset"【4:4†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:11†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones suggests that the dataset's reliability as a ground truth for these types of clones is questionable. This could affect the validity of the paper's results, especially since WT3/T4 clones were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology's reliance on potentially inaccurate data for WT3/T4 clones could lead to misleading conclusions about the effectiveness of the proposed method. The generalizability of the results may be compromised if the dataset's ground truth is flawed, particularly for WT3/T4 clones. This necessitates a re-evaluation of the method's performance on a more reliable dataset or a filtered version excluding WT3/T4 pairs.
