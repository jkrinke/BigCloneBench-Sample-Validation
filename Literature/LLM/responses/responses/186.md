# Analysis of Paper 186

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Cross-Language Code Search using Static and Dynamic Analyses
- **Authors:** George Mathew and Kathryn T. Stolee
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:16†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents COSAL, a novel cross-language code-to-code search tool that leverages both static and dynamic analyses to improve search results. The study evaluates COSAL against state-of-the-art tools like FaCoY and GitHub Search, using datasets such as AtCoder and BigCloneBench. The methodology involves non-dominated sorting of similarity measures, including token-based, AST-based, and IO-based analyses. Key findings indicate that COSAL outperforms existing tools in both cross-language and within-language contexts, demonstrating higher precision and recall. The paper concludes that COSAL's approach is promising for future applications in code search and clone detection【4:16†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two main datasets for evaluation: AtCoder, a programming contest dataset, and BigCloneBench, a Java-based clone detection benchmark. Specifically, it utilizes 43,146 Java and Python files from AtCoder and 55,499 Java files from BigCloneBench【4:1†source】【4:2†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool and evaluates it, rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "We present COSAL, a cross-language code-to-code search tool that uses static and dynamic analyses"【4:6†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces COSAL, a new tool for cross-language code-to-code search.
  - **Quote:** "We propose the first cross-language code-to-code search approach with dynamic and static similarity measures"【4:16†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the datasets for evaluating COSAL.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluate COSAL using...55,499 Java files from BigCloneBench"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** "COSAL does not use machine learning models"【4:7†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using 55,499 Java files, which aligns with the old version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench [79] is one of the largest publicly available code clone benchmarks for Java with over 55,000 source code files"【4:2†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions filtering out fragments of code with less than 6 lines or 50 tokens.
  - **Quote:** "Fragments of code with less than 6 lines or 50 tokens are not considered"【4:2†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4 subsets.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using subsets from previous work.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were used, the precision and recall metrics reported could be inflated, affecting the reliability of the conclusions. The generalizability of COSAL's effectiveness might be questioned if the dataset's integrity is compromised. However, without explicit mention of WT3/T4 usage, the exact impact is uncertain.

# Summary

```
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 186, No, Yes, Yes, No, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, No, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded, hence "Not specified."
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation, hence "Potentially."
