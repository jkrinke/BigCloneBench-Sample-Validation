# Analysis of Paper 155

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Intelligent Token-Based Code Clone Detection System for Large Scale Source Code
- **Authors:** Abdulrahman Abu Elkhail, Jan Svacina, Tomas Cerny
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:5†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel token-based code clone detection tool named ICDT, designed to identify both exact and near-miss clones in large-scale software repositories. The methodology involves a multi-phase process including lexical analysis and transformation of source code into token sequences, followed by match detection. The tool's performance is evaluated using the BigCloneBench benchmark, demonstrating competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art tools. The study concludes that ICDT is effective for large-scale clone detection and suggests future improvements for multi-language support【4:5†source】【4:13†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is a benchmark consisting of manually validated clones within the IJaDataset 2.0【4:15†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool rather than reviewing existing literature comprehensively.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a new token-based tool called ICDT in order to detect the code clones for a large scale software system"【4:17†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new tool, ICDT, for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a new token-based tool called ICDT"【4:17†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates ICDT using the BigCloneBench benchmark.
  - **Quote:** "We measure its recall using a state-of-the-art clone benchmark, the BigCloneBench"【4:13†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "We measure its recall using a state-of-the-art clone benchmark, the BigCloneBench"【4:13†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a snapshot with 43 target functionalities.
  - **Quote:** "A snapshot of the BigCloneBench benchmark with 43 target functionalities has been used for this study"【4:15†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper specifies using clones that are at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length.
  - **Quote:** "We use only the clones that are at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length"【4:15†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Yes, excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper reports zero recall for WT3/T4 clones.
  - **Quote:** "ICDT has a poor recall for the MT3 and WT3/T4 as these clones fall outside the range of syntactical clone detectors"【4:14†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a snapshot of BigCloneBench directly.
  - **Quote:** "A snapshot of the BigCloneBench benchmark with 43 target functionalities has been used for this study"【4:15†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:3†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones suggests that the zero recall for WT3/T4 in ICDT might not be as detrimental as initially thought, but it also questions the validity of using WT3/T4 as a benchmark for clone detection.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of ICDT for detecting WT3/T4 clones are affected. The generalizability of the results is limited, as the benchmark's reliability is compromised for these clone types. This could lead to reconsideration of the evaluation metrics and the perceived performance of ICDT in detecting certain clone types.

**Note:**  
- **F:** The paper uses a filtered subset of BigCloneBench, focusing on clones that are at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length.
- **G:** The WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation due to poor recall.
- **L:** The finding regarding WT3/T4 clones potentially weakens the claims about ICDT's performance on these clone types.
