# Analysis of Paper 5

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Evaluating Clone Detection Tools with BigCloneBench
- **Authors:** Jeffrey Svajlenko, Chanchal K. Roy
- **Publication Year:** 2015【4:0†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper titled "Evaluating Clone Detection Tools with BigCloneBench" by Jeffrey Svajlenko and Chanchal K. Roy aims to evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools using BigCloneBench, a large-scale benchmark of manually validated clones. The study compares the performance of these tools in detecting clones across different types and levels of syntactical similarity, using both intra-project and inter-project scenarios. The authors also compare these results with a synthetic benchmark, the Mutation and Injection Framework, to assess the accuracy of the tools and the benchmarks. The findings indicate that while the tools perform well for Type-1 and Type-2 clones, their performance declines for Type-3 clones with lower syntactical similarity. The study concludes that improvements are needed in detecting Type-3 and Type-4 clones while maintaining high precision【4:0†source】【4:2†source】【4:17†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench as the primary dataset for evaluating the recall of clone detection tools. It also employs the Mutation and Injection Framework as a synthetic benchmark to compare and validate the results obtained from BigCloneBench【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study evaluating clone detection tools using a benchmark.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools using BigCloneBench." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the recall of existing clone detection tools.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools using BigCloneBench." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the primary benchmark for evaluating the tools.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools using BigCloneBench." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools using BigCloneBench." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions the benchmark contains 8 million clone pairs across 43 functionalities.
  - **Quote:** "The current version of the benchmark contains 8 million clone pairs across 43 functionalities." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses clones that are at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length and excludes files longer than 2000 lines.
  - **Quote:** "We use only the clones that are at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length." (Page 132)【4:11†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its evaluation but notes negligible recall for these categories.
  - **Quote:** "We do not include the MT3 and WT3/T4 categories as the tools have negligible recall for these clone categories." (Page 137)【4:15†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the benchmark as provided without further modifications.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench was built by mining thousands of software systems for clones of 43 functionalities." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the current version of BigCloneBench directly.
  - **Quote:** "The current version of the benchmark contains 8 million clone pairs across 43 functionalities." (Page 52)【4:2†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:1†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, especially concerning the evaluation of tools' recall for these clone types.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of clone detection tools for WT3/T4 clones may be compromised. The generalizability of the results is affected as the tools' performance on these clone types might have been overestimated. This could lead to a reassessment of the tools' capabilities and the reliability of BigCloneBench as a benchmark for these clone types.
