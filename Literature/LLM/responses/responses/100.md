# Analysis of Paper 100

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Investigating the Generalizability of Deep Learning-based Clone Detectors
- **Authors:** Eunjong Choi, Norihiro Fuke, Yuji Fujiwara, Norihiro Yoshida, and Katsuro Inoue
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:4†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper investigates the generalizability of deep learning-based clone detectors, specifically CCLearner, ASTNN, and CodeBERT, by evaluating their detection accuracy across different clone benchmarks. The study aims to address the challenge of poor generalizability in these models, which often results from overfitting to training data. The methodology involves training and testing the models on different benchmarks, including BigCloneBench (BCB), Google Code Jam (GCJ), and CodeNet (CN), to assess their performance. Key findings indicate that the generalizability of these models is low, with a strong relationship between clone types and detection accuracy for CCLearner and ASTNN, but a weak relationship for CodeBERT. The paper concludes that developers should be cautious when using these models for new software systems due to their limited generalizability【4:4†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses three clone benchmarks for evaluation: BigCloneBench (BCB), Google Code Jam (GCJ), and CodeNet (CN)【4:5†source】【4:9†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study investigating the generalizability of clone detectors.
  - **Quote:** "This study investigates the generalizability of three DL-based clone detectors..."【4:4†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the generalizability of existing DL-based clone detectors.
  - **Quote:** "This study investigates the generalizability of three DL-based clone detectors (CCLearner, ASTNN, and CodeBERT)..."【4:4†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is one of the benchmarks used for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "In this study, we used three representative clone benchmarks, namely BCB, GCJ, and CN."【4:9†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BCB for training and testing the clone detectors.
  - **Quote:** "We trained CCLearner, ASTNN and CodeBERT on BCB and tested them on GCJ or CN, and vice versa."【4:14†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BCB v1 for CCLearner and BCB ERA v1 for ASTNN.
  - **Quote:** "In RQ1, we utilized the BCB versions that were used in each paper, BCB v1 for CCLearner and BCB ERA v1 for ASTNN."【4:15†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No specific filtering or modification mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any filtering or modification of BCB.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on the exclusion of WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the BCB versions as they are.
  - **Quote:** "We used the version of BCB used in the papers because we believe that they were trained on BCB for the best accuracy."【4:12†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BCB versions as used in previous works.
  - **Quote:** "We utilized the BCB versions that were used in each paper..."【4:15†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BCB’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the provided references【4:16†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, especially since the paper evaluates the generalizability of clone detectors using BCB, which includes WT3/T4 clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions regarding the generalizability of clone detectors might be compromised due to the reliance on potentially inaccurate ground truth data. This could affect the generalizability claims made for CCLearner, ASTNN, and CodeBERT, as their performance might have been evaluated on incorrect clone pairs【4:12†source】【4:13†source】.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 100, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Not specified, Not specified, No, Yes, No, No, Yes
```

**Note:**  
- For questions F and G, the paper does not explicitly mention any filtering or exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset, hence "Not specified" is used.
- Question L is marked as "Yes" because the recent finding about WT3/T4 pairs potentially impacts the validity of the paper's results.
