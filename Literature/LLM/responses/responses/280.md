- **Authors:** Aiping Zhang, Liming Fang, Chunpeng Ge, Piji Li, Zhe Liu
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:4†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a novel approach to code clone detection using a Transformer-based model enhanced with a code token learner. The objective is to efficiently detect code clones, especially in long code fragments, by reducing computational costs. The methodology involves using a graph convolutional network to capture code structure and a tree-based position embedding to represent node positions in abstract syntax trees. The study evaluates the proposed method on two datasets, BigCloneBench and OJClone, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The conclusions highlight the method's effectiveness in modeling long-range dependencies within code, achieving significant improvements in detection performance【4:18†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench and OJClone. BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the method's performance in detecting type-3 and type-4 clones, while OJClone is used to assess the generalization ability across different programming languages【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method using a Transformer with a code token learner.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a feasible way to apply the Transformer for efficient code clone detection"【4:2†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is one of the datasets used for evaluating the proposed method.
  - **Quote:** "We train and evaluate our method on two datasets: BigCloneBench and OJClone"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used for training and evaluating the method.
  - **Quote:** "We train and evaluate our method on two datasets: BigCloneBench and OJClone"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset description matches the old version with over 6 million clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench. This dataset contains over 6,000,000 positive clone pairs and 260,000 negative clone pairs"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** A subset of 6 million positive clone pairs and 260 thousand negative clone pairs is used.
  - **Quote:** "Similarly, 6 million positive clone pairs and 260 thousand negative clone pairs are randomly chosen from BigCloneBench dataset"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was not excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "The majority of code clone pairs are weakly type-3/type-4"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper follows the setup of previous work.
  - **Quote:** "We follow FA-AST (Wang et al., 2020a) to set up the datasets"【4:7†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:15†280_10.1016_j.jss.2022.111557.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** Since 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones, the reliability of the evaluation results using these pairs is questionable.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology's reliance on potentially incorrect ground truth could affect the validity of the results. The conclusions about the method's effectiveness in detecting clones, especially WT3/T4, may not be as robust as claimed. This finding could limit the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios where accurate clone detection is critical.
