# Analysis of Paper 198

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** ASPDup: AST-Sequence-based Progressive Duplicate Code Detection Tool for Onsite Programming Code
- **Authors:** Yu Yaoshen, Huang Zhiqiu, Zhou Yu, Li Weiwei, Shao Yichao
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:17†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces ASPDup, a novel tool for detecting duplicate code during the programming phase using an AST-sequence-based approach. The tool is designed to handle incomplete code fragments, which are common in onsite programming, by transforming source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then into an encoded sequence. A local sequence alignment algorithm is employed to identify highly similar subsequences. The study evaluates ASPDup using datasets like OJ-System and a reduced version of BigCloneBench, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting duplicate code across different granularities. The authors conclude that ASPDup can significantly aid in early detection of duplicate code, potentially reducing maintenance costs【4:17†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: OJ-System and a reduced version of BigCloneBench【4:14†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool and its evaluation, not a review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose an AST-Sequence-based progressive duplicate code detection approach for onsite programming code"【4:15†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces ASPDup, a new tool for detecting duplicate code.
  - **Quote:** "We propose an AST-Sequence-based progressive duplicate code detection approach"【4:15†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a reduced version of BigCloneBench for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "OJ-System and a reduced BigCloneBench are used for the evaluations"【4:14†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify which version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper only mentions using a "reduced BigCloneBench" without specifying the version.
  - **Quote:** "a reduced BigCloneBench"【4:14†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been reduced.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a reduced version of BigCloneBench but does not specify the size.
  - **Quote:** "a reduced BigCloneBench"【4:14†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of WT3/T4 subsets in the paper.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond using a reduced version.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the evaluation results if these pairs were included in the reduced dataset used.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the reduced BigCloneBench used in the study included WT3/T4 pairs, the evaluation results might be skewed, affecting the reliability of the tool's performance claims. This could lead to overestimating the tool's effectiveness in detecting true duplicates, thus impacting the generalizability of the conclusions. However, without specific details on the subset used, the exact impact remains uncertain.
