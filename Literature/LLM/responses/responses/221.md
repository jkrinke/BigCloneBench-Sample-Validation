# Analysis of Paper 221

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** An Extensive Study on Adversarial Attack against Pre-trained Models of Code
- **Authors:** Xiaohu Du, Ming Wen, Zichao Wei, Shangwen Wang, and Hai Jin
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:16†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper titled "An Extensive Study on Adversarial Attack against Pre-trained Models of Code" investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of adversarial attacks on pre-trained models for code processing tasks, including clone detection, vulnerability detection, and code summarization. The study employs various adversarial attack strategies to evaluate their impact on model performance, using datasets like BigCloneBench for clone detection. The authors propose a novel attack approach, BeamAttack, which demonstrates improved attack success rates and efficiency compared to existing methods. The study concludes with insights into the robustness of pre-trained models and the quality of adversarial examples, providing a foundation for future research in enhancing model resilience【4:16†source】【4:3†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses several datasets for evaluation, including BigCloneBench for clone detection, the OWASP Benchmark for vulnerability detection, and CodeSearchNet for code summarization【4:3†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study focusing on adversarial attacks against pre-trained models of code, not a literature review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "The goal of this study is to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of the SOTA adversarial attack approaches against various PTMC under different PL tasks"【4:9†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates existing adversarial attack approaches and proposes a new method called BeamAttack.
  - **Quote:** "Our tool aims to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency while guaranteeing the naturalness, and the novelty of which is mainly embodied in the following two aspects"【4:8†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as a benchmark for evaluating clone detection tasks.
  - **Quote:** "For clone detection, BigCloneBench [27] is a widely used clone detection benchmark"【4:3†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "We select representative benchmarks to evaluate them. For clone detection, BigCloneBench [27] is a widely used clone detection benchmark"【4:3†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "For clone detection, BigCloneBench [27] is a widely used clone detection benchmark"【4:3†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was filtered to remove unlabeled data and balance the labels.
  - **Quote:** "Their filtering strategies include removing unlabeled data, balancing the two labels (clones and non-clones), and making the data at a computationally friendly scale"【4:3†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on the exclusion of specific subsets like WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper only mentions filtering strategies, not other modifications.
  - **Quote:** "Their filtering strategies include removing unlabeled data, balancing the two labels (clones and non-clones)"【4:3†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a filtered dataset proposed by Yang et al.
  - **Quote:** "To better evaluate the adversarial attacks, we adopt the filtered dataset proposed by Yang et al."【4:3†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's reliability and the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of adversarial attacks on clone detection could be compromised. The generalizability of the findings might also be affected, as the dataset's integrity is crucial for accurate evaluation.
