# Analysis of Paper 49

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Semantic Clone Detection Using Machine Learning
- **Authors:** Abdullah Sheneamer, Jugal Kalita
- **Publication Year:** 2016【4:12†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a machine learning framework for detecting semantic clones in software, focusing on Type-3 and Type-4 clones. The authors introduce novel features extracted from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Program Dependency Graphs (PDGs) to improve clone detection accuracy. They employ various classification algorithms, including Xgboost, to evaluate the effectiveness of these features. The study demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances clone detection performance compared to traditional approaches, achieving high precision and recall rates. The authors conclude that their approach is effective for detecting both syntactic and semantic clones and plan to extend their work to unsupervised learning in the future【4:12†source】【4:16†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the IJaDataset 2.0, which includes BigCloneBench, for evaluating their clone detection approach. They focus on a subset of the dataset, specifically targeting Type-3 and Type-4 clones【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we present a machine learning framework to automatically detect clones in software"【4:12†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces new features and a machine learning framework for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "The novel aspects of our approach are the extraction of features from abstract syntax trees (AST) and program dependency graphs (PDG)"【4:12†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as part of the IJaDataset 2.0 for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "As our target we use IJaDataset 2.0, a large inter-project Java repository called BigCloneBench"【4:0†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** "We use extracted features to learn a model to detect syntactic and semantic clones"【4:12†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions 44 target functionalities, which aligns with the new version.
  - **Quote:** "The published version of the benchmark considers 44 target functionalities"【4:0†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of 4,000 pair instances for each clone type.
  - **Quote:** "We randomly extract sample data for 4,000 pair instances for each of VST3, ST3, MT3 and W3/4 clones"【4:4†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** WT3/4 clones are part of the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We randomly extract sample data for 4,000 pair instances for each of VST3, ST3, MT3 and W3/4 clones"【4:4†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The subset was created specifically for this study.
  - **Quote:** "We randomly extract sample data for 4,000 pair instances"【4:4†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:16†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could significantly affect the validity of the results, especially since WT3/4 clones are part of the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions, as the high false positive rate in WT3/T4 could lead to overestimated performance metrics. The generalizability of the results is also compromised, as the dataset's reliability is in question【4:4†source】【4:16†source】.
