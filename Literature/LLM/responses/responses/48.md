# Analysis of Paper 48

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Natural Attack for Pre-trained Models of Code
- **Authors:** Zhou Yang, Jieke Shi, Junda He, and David Lo
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:17†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper titled "Natural Attack for Pre-trained Models of Code" investigates the vulnerability of pre-trained models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT to adversarial attacks. The authors propose ALERT, a novel black-box attack method that generates adversarial examples by considering both operational and natural semantics. The study evaluates ALERT's effectiveness across three tasks: vulnerability prediction, clone detection, and code authorship attribution. The results demonstrate that ALERT achieves higher attack success rates compared to existing methods and improves the robustness of models through adversarial fine-tuning. The paper concludes that ALERT can significantly enhance the naturalness and effectiveness of adversarial examples【4:17†source】【4:11†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses three datasets for evaluation: a vulnerability prediction dataset from FFmpeg and Qemu, the BigCloneBench dataset for clone detection, and the Google Code Jam dataset for authorship attribution【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study focusing on adversarial attacks on pre-trained models, not a literature review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose ALERT (Naturalness Aware Attack), a black-box attack that adversarially transforms inputs to make victim models produce wrong outputs."【4:17†source】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it evaluates existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the robustness of existing pre-trained models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT against adversarial attacks.
  - **Quote:** "This paper investigates the victim models that are fine-tuned on the state-of-the-art pre-trained models, CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT."【4:18†source】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as a benchmark for evaluating clone detection tasks.
  - **Quote:** "The clone detection task aims to check whether two given code snippets are clones... BigCloneBench is a broadly recognized benchmark for clone detection."【4:1†source】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used for evaluation, not for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "We filtered the data which do not have a label and then balanced the dataset to make the ratio of true and false pairs to 1:1."【4:1†source】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions the dataset covering ten functionalities, which corresponds to the old version.
  - **Quote:** "In total, the dataset has covered ten frequently-used functionalities."【4:1†source】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was filtered to balance the ratio of true and false pairs.
  - **Quote:** "Following the settings of prior works, we filtered the data which do not have a label and then balanced the dataset to make the ratio of true and false pairs to 1:1."【4:1†source】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded or included.
  - **Quote:** N/A

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering for balance.
  - **Quote:** N/A

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper follows the settings of prior works for filtering.
  - **Quote:** "Following the settings of prior works, we filtered the data which do not have a label."【4:1†source】

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** N/A

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** N/A

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of the clone detection results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** N/A

- **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:**
  - The methodology might be affected if the WT3/T4 subset was included without filtering, leading to potential inaccuracies in clone detection results. This could also affect the generalizability of the conclusions regarding the robustness of the models against adversarial attacks in the context of clone detection. However, without explicit mention of WT3/T4, the exact impact remains speculative.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 48, No, Yes, Yes, No, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, Yes, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- For question G, the paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded or included, hence "Not specified" is used.
- For question L, the impact of the new findings is marked as "Potentially" because the paper does not explicitly mention the inclusion or exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset, which affects the certainty of the impact.
