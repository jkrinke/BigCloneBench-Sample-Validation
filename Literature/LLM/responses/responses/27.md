# Analysis of Paper 27

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** You Look so Different: Finding Structural Clones and Subclones in Java Source Code
- **Authors:** Wolfram Amme, Thomas S. Heinze, André Schäfer
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:5†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel method for detecting code clones, particularly focusing on structural clones and subclones in Java source code. The proposed method leverages control flow analysis and dominator trees to identify clones, which is implemented in a tool called StoneDetector. The study evaluates StoneDetector against the BigCloneBench benchmark, demonstrating its competitive performance in detecting exact and near-miss clones, as well as its ability to identify clones with larger syntactical variance. The authors conclude that their approach is effective and scalable, offering improvements over existing clone detection tools【4:5†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench as the primary dataset for evaluating the StoneDetector tool. It compares the tool's performance with other state-of-the-art clone detection tools using this benchmark【4:8†source】【4:18†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method for clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect code clones in source code."【4:5†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method based on control flow analysis and dominator trees.
  - **Quote:** "For the identification of code clones, in particular structural clones and subclones, we propose a novel clone detection method."【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the benchmark for evaluating the StoneDetector tool.
  - **Quote:** "We have chosen BigCloneBench as the state-of-the-art benchmark for Java source code clone detection to answer these research questions."【4:8†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** The paper focuses on evaluation rather than training【4:8†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions more than 8 million known clone pairs, aligning with the new version.
  - **Quote:** "In total, BigCloneBench contains more than 8 million known clone pairs of different syntactical similarity."【4:18†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify any filtering or modification of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** The evaluation uses the dataset as is【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No exclusion is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention excluding any subsets from the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** The evaluation considers all clone types【4:18†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as provided without changes.
  - **Quote:** The dataset is used as a benchmark without modifications【4:8†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the full dataset as provided by BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** The dataset is used in its entirety【4:18†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** The focus is on evaluation using the dataset【4:8†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The references do not include this citation【4:2†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the results, especially if the evaluation heavily relies on these pairs.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology might need reassessment to ensure that the results are not skewed by incorrect ground truth data. The conclusions about the tool's effectiveness in detecting Type 3 and 4 clones might be less reliable, affecting the generalizability of the findings. The paper's claims about the tool's performance could be overstated if based on flawed data【4:8†source】【4:18†source】.

**Note:**  
- **L (Potentially):** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if the evaluation heavily relies on these pairs. This could affect the methodology and conclusions regarding the tool's effectiveness in detecting certain types of clones【4:8†source】【4:18†source】.
