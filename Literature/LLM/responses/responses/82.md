# Analysis of Paper 82

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Comparison and Evaluation of Clone Detection Techniques with Different Code Representations
- **Authors:** Yuekun Wang, Yuhang Ye, Yueming Wu, Weiwei Zhang, Yinxing Xue, Yang Liu
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:6†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of different code representations in clone detection. It reproduces 12 clone detection algorithms and categorizes them based on their code representations: text-based, token-based, tree-based, and graph-based. The study aims to determine which representation is most effective for detecting code clones and how to combine them for optimal performance. The authors propose a new tool, TACC, which combines token-based and AST-based methods, demonstrating superior performance in detecting large-scale code clones compared to existing tools. The study concludes that token and tree representations are more effective for simple clones, while graph representations are better for complex clones【4:6†source】【4:0†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically to assess the performance of the TACC tool and compare it with other state-of-the-art clone detection tools【4:9†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study, not a systematic literature review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we present an empirical study to compare the clone detection ability of different code representations"【4:6†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new tool, TACC, which combines token-based and AST-based methods for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We develop the suitable combination into a tool called TACC and evaluate it with other state-of-the-art code clone detectors"【4:6†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the TACC tool using the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We then evaluate TACC on the BigCloneBench dataset"【4:9†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The version is not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify whether the old or new version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a subset of BigCloneBench for parameter tuning.
  - **Quote:** "We measure recall and execution time for different N (i.e., 1-5) on a subset of BigCloneBench"【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on the exclusion or inclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes, extensions, or enrichment to the BigCloneBench ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether these subsets were used.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 pairs were part of the evaluation, the methodology's reliability could be questioned, potentially affecting the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the TACC tool. The generalizability of the results might also be compromised if the dataset's integrity is in question.
