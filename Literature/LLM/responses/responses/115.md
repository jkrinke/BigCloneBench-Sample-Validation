# Analysis of Paper 115

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** TransformCode: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Code Embedding via Subtree Transformation
- **Authors:** Z. Xian, M. Azam, M. Amayri, W. Fan, and N. Bouguila
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:0†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel framework called TransformCode, which leverages contrastive learning for code embedding by applying subtree transformations to Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The objective is to improve code-clone detection, code classification, and method-name prediction without requiring labeled data. The methodology involves normalizing code, transforming it into ASTs, and using contrastive learning to generate embeddings that capture semantic similarities. The framework was evaluated on datasets like POJ-104 and BigCloneBench, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods such as CodeBERT and InferCode. The authors conclude that TransformCode is effective for unsupervised learning tasks and can be adapted for supervised tasks by incorporating labels into the contrastive loss【4:7†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: POJ-104 and BigCloneBench. POJ-104 contains semantically equivalent but syntactically different code pairs written in C, while BigCloneBench is a benchmark dataset comprising projects from 25,000 Java repositories【4:1†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel framework rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel method for code-clone detection based on code normalization, code transformation, and contrastive learning"【4:0†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces TransformCode, a new framework for code-clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel method for code-clone detection based on code normalization, code transformation, and contrastive learning"【4:0†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the datasets for evaluating the proposed method.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluated our method on two code-clone detection datasets: POJ-104 and BigCloneBench"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for training in an unsupervised setting.
  - **Quote:** "We trained our framework’s encoder with different parameter configurations on the Java-based BigCloneBench dataset"【4:1†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions the dataset covers ten functionalities, aligning with the old version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench is a widely used benchmark dataset... It covers ten functionalities"【4:1†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** Duplicate samples were filtered out, resulting in 7,302 unique samples.
  - **Quote:** "We filtered out duplicate samples from the BigCloneBench training set. Finally, we obtained 7302 unique samples for training"【4:1†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering duplicates.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's reliability could be compromised, affecting the conclusions drawn about the framework's effectiveness. The generalizability of the results might also be questioned if the dataset's integrity is compromised by incorrect clone pairs.

# Summary

```
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 115, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, No, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- For question G, the paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- For question L, the potential impact is noted due to the lack of specification regarding the inclusion of WT3/T4 pairs, which could affect the validity of the results if these pairs were included.
