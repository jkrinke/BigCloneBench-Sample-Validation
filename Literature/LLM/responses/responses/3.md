# Analysis of Paper 3

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Investigating Vector-Based Detection of Code Clones Using BigCloneBench
- **Authors:** Kazuki Yokoi, Eunjong Choi, Norihiro Yoshida, Katsuro Inoue
- **Publication Year:** 2018【4:3†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper investigates the effectiveness of vector-based approaches for detecting code clones using BigCloneBench. The authors aim to improve the Function Level Code Clone Finder (FLCCFinder) by exploring various vectorization algorithms and similarity measurements. They evaluate the recall and detection time of different algorithms, including TF-IDF, LSI, LDA, Word2Vec, and FastText, using cosine similarity and Word Mover’s Distance. The study finds that algorithms like WV-avg and FT-avg achieve high recall, particularly for Type-2 clones, but notes the impracticality of using WMD due to its computational cost. The paper concludes that dimensional compression and deep neural networks are effective for clone detection【4:3†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses BigCloneBench as the primary dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of different vectorization algorithms in detecting code clones【4:1†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates existing vectorization algorithms and similarity measures for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "To improve FLCCFinder, we preliminary investigated what kind of vectorization algorithms and distance measures are effective in terms of recall and detection time"【4:3†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the benchmark dataset for evaluating the clone detection methods.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we present preliminary investigation results using BigCloneBench, a large-scale code clone benchmark"【4:3†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** "To investigate the impact of vectorization algorithms and similarity measurements for detecting code clones, we set up two research question(RQ)s as follows"【4:1†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench with 2.3 million Java source files, which aligns with the old version.
  - **Quote:** "We applied an approach using each selected vectorization algorithm with FLCCFinder to 25,000 open-source projects in BigCloneBench, consisting of 2.3 million Java source files"【4:1†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, filtered.
  - **Explanation:** A subset of 1MLOC was created for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "To investigate the speed of calculation vector, we built 1MLOC dataset by randomly selecting files from BigCloneBench"【4:5†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, not excluded.
  - **Explanation:** WT3/T4 is included in the evaluation results.
  - **Quote:** "Weakly Type-3/Type-4 (WT3/T4) 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.00 0.08 0.05"【4:6†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The subset was created by the authors for this study.
  - **Quote:** "We built 1MLOC dataset by randomly selecting files from BigCloneBench"【4:5†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:4†3_10.1109_APSEC.2018.00095.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, especially since WT3/T4 was included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions, as the inclusion of erroneous WT3/T4 pairs could lead to misleading recall results and affect the generalizability of the findings. The paper's conclusions about the effectiveness of vectorization algorithms for detecting WT3/T4 clones may be invalidated due to the high rate of false positives in the dataset.
