# Analysis of Paper 141

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Code Clone Detection Using Boosting Algorithms
- **Authors:** M.V. Thanoshan, Kuhaneswaran Banujan, B.T.G.S Kumara, S. Prasanth, Zhenni Li, Incheon Paik
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:6†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a machine-learning approach for detecting code clones using boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. The study focuses on extracting features from source code using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to classify code clones into different types, excluding Type-2. The methodology involves feature extraction, data pre-processing, and model training with hyper-parameter tuning. The results indicate that LightGBM outperforms other classifiers with the highest F1 score of 0.81. The study concludes by suggesting future work on identifying Type-2 clones and improving clone detection performance【4:6†source】【4:3†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is a prominent repository in code clone detection studies【4:12†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, the author presents a machine-learning approach for detecting code clones"【4:6†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a novel machine-learning approach using boosting algorithms for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "The author presents a machine-learning approach for detecting code clones"【4:6†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper explicitly mentions using BigCloneBench for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "This study uses BigCloneBench, a big data inter-project Java repository"【4:12†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** "The author retrieved 4190 pairs for every kind from the BigCloneBench repository"【4:16†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of 25,140 pair instances.
  - **Quote:** "In total, the author retrieved 25140 pair instances representing six target classes"【4:16†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** The WT3/4 subset is part of the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "Hence, for classifying code clones properly, this study focuses on six target classes – T1, VST3, ST3, MT3, WT3/4, and False"【4:16†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes or extensions to the ground truth beyond filtering.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of validation or manual investigation of the ground truth.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, especially since WT3/4 is included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions, as the reliability of the WT3/4 subset as ground truth is compromised. The generalizability of the results is also affected, as the paper's claims about clone detection accuracy may be overstated due to the inclusion of incorrect clone pairs【4:16†source】.
