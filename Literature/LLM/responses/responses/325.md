# Analysis of Paper 325

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Precise Code Clone Detection with Architecture of Abstract Syntax Trees
- **Authors:** Xin Guo, Ruyun Zhang, Lu Zhou, and Xiaozhen Lu
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:11†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a novel approach for code clone detection that combines token-based similarity with the architecture of abstract syntax trees (ASTs). This method aims to improve the precision of clone detection while maintaining efficiency, particularly in large-scale databases. The study utilizes the BigCloneBench dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, demonstrating significant improvements in precision over existing methods like SourcererCC. The authors conclude that their method effectively reduces false positives and enhances detection precision, especially for Type 2 clones【4:11†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically mentioning its use in conjunction with IJaDataset. The dataset is divided into 830,684 functions with a total size of 531.9MB【4:8†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature comprehensively.
  - **Quote:** "In the field of code clone detection, there are token-based similarity and abstract syntax tree-based detection methods"【4:11†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method combining tokens and ASTs for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "An approach is proposed that can detect code clones using the similarity of tokens and architecture of abstract syntax trees"【4:11†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as part of its evaluation dataset.
  - **Quote:** "The experimental data is provided by IJaDataset in BigCloneBench"【4:8†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions BigCloneBench but does not specify whether it is the old or new version.
  - **Quote:** "The experimental data is provided by IJaDataset in BigCloneBench"【4:8†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been divided into a subset.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is divided into 830,684 functions.
  - **Quote:** "To see the results more intuitively, we divided data set into 830,684 functions"【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of WT3/T4 subsets in the paper.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes or extensions to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no citation of this work in the paper.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these subsets were used, as it would mean a significant portion of the dataset is unreliable.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subsets were used, the methodology's reliability could be compromised, leading to potential inaccuracies in the conclusions about the precision and recall improvements claimed by the paper. The generalizability of the findings could also be affected if the dataset's integrity is questioned. However, since the paper does not specify using these subsets, the direct impact is uncertain.

**Note:**  
- **E:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench was used.
- **G:** The paper does not mention the WT3/T4 subsets, so their exclusion is not specified.
- **L:** The recent finding about WT3/T4 pairs potentially impacts the paper's claims if these subsets were used, but this is not specified in the paper.
