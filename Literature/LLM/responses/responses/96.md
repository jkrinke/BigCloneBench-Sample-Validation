# Analysis of Paper 96

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Code2Img: Tree-Based Image Transformation for Scalable Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Yutao Hu, Yilin Fang, Yifan Sun, Yaru Jia, Yueming Wu, Deqing Zou, and Hai Jin
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:2†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents **Code2Img**, a novel approach for scalable and effective code clone detection. The method transforms abstract syntax trees (ASTs) into images, which are then encoded into vectors using a Markov model to preserve structural details. The approach aims to balance scalability and the ability to detect complex clone types. The authors conducted comparative evaluations against eight state-of-the-art clone detectors using the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrating that Code2Img outperforms others in terms of detection effectiveness and scalability【4:2†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the **BigCloneBench (BCB)** dataset for evaluation, which includes more than 8,000,000 function pairs labeled as "clone" and "non-clone"【4:8†source】【4:10†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose Code2Img, a tree-based code clone detector..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces Code2Img, a new method for code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose Code2Img, a tree-based code clone detector..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper conducts experiments using the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on a widely used dataset, BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used for evaluation, not for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct comparative evaluations on effectiveness and scalability with eight other state-of-the-art clone detectors..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset description matches the new version with over 8,000,000 function pairs.
  - **Quote:** "It is manually labeled as 'clone' and 'non-clone' for more than 8,000,000 function pairs..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No specific filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not detail any filtering or modification of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on a widely used dataset, BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Yes, T4 is not the focus.
  - **Explanation:** The paper focuses on other clone types rather than T4 due to its complexity.
  - **Quote:** "Therefore, we pay attention to other types rather than T4 clones."【4:10†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as provided without changes.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on a widely used dataset, BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on a widely used dataset, BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on a widely used dataset, BigCloneBench (BCB)..."【4:8†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The references do not include this citation【4:0†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper focuses on other clone types, minimizing this impact.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions might remain largely unaffected due to the focus on other clone types. However, the generalizability of results to T4 clones is limited, and the paper's claims about handling complex clones might need reconsideration if T4 clones were included.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 96, No, Yes, Yes, No, New, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper focuses on other clone types rather than T4 clones, which implies exclusion of T4.
- **L:** The finding about WT3/T4 pairs potentially impacts the paper's claims if these pairs were included, but the focus on other clone types minimizes this effect.
