# Analysis of Paper 381

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** IBFET: Index-based features extraction technique for scalable code clone detection at file level granularity
- **Authors:** Junaid Akram, Majid Mumtaz, Ping Luo
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:1†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents the Index-Based Features Extraction Technique (IBFET) for scalable code clone detection at the file level. The objective is to efficiently detect code clones in large-scale systems using a distributed environment. The methodology involves preprocessing, indexing, and clone detection using a Hadoop cluster, which allows the system to handle billions of lines of code. The study evaluates IBFET using datasets like IJaDataset and BigCloneBench, demonstrating high accuracy and scalability compared to existing tools. The paper concludes that IBFET is effective for large-scale clone detection and plans to extend its capabilities to additional programming languages【4:1†source】【4:4†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the IJaDataset and BigCloneBench datasets for evaluating the IBFET approach【4:1†source】【4:4†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel technique rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents index-based features extraction technique (IBFET) to detect code clones at a very large-scale level"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces IBFET, a new technique for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents index-based features extraction technique (IBFET) to detect code clones"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the IBFET approach.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluated IBFET performance by BigCloneBench"【4:17†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using BigCloneBench but does not specify which version.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluated IBFET performance by BigCloneBench"【4:17†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, WT3/T4 clones were not evaluated.
  - **Explanation:** The paper excludes WT3/T4 clones from evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "WT3/T4 clones were not evaluated because they are out of the scope of our paper"【4:14†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Yes, WT3/T4 was excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper explicitly states that WT3/T4 clones were not evaluated.
  - **Quote:** "WT3/T4 clones were not evaluated because they are out of the scope of our paper"【4:14†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The exclusion of WT3/T4 clones, which are now known to be mostly non-clones, suggests that the paper's evaluation might not fully represent the dataset's challenges.
  - **Impact:** The methodology and conclusions might be affected as the paper's evaluation does not account for the inaccuracies in WT3/T4 clones. This could impact the generalizability of the results, as the dataset used for evaluation might not accurately reflect real-world clone detection challenges【4:14†source】.
