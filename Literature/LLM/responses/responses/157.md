# Analysis of Paper 157

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Assessing and Improving an Evaluation Dataset for Detecting Semantic Code Clones via Deep Learning
- **Authors:** Hao Yu, Xing Hu, Ge Li, Ying Li, Qianxiang Wang, Tao Xie
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:4†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper investigates the effectiveness of BigCloneBench, a popular dataset for evaluating semantic code clone detection models, by highlighting its reliance on identifier names. The authors propose a novel approach, Linear-Model, which uses only identifier names to detect clones, achieving high effectiveness on BigCloneBench. To address this issue, they introduce AbsBigCloneBench, a modified version of BigCloneBench with abstracted identifier names, to better assess deep learning models. The study concludes that models trained on AbsBigCloneBench are less dependent on identifier names and more effective in general, suggesting that researchers should consider identifier abstraction for more accurate evaluations【4:0†source】【4:10†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses three datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench, OJClone, and AbsBigCloneBench. BigCloneBench is used to assess the effectiveness of clone detection approaches, while AbsBigCloneBench is introduced to mitigate the reliance on identifier names. OJClone serves as a comparison to demonstrate the limitations of identifier-based detection【4:1†source】【4:18†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an experimental study, not a review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "In this article, we present an experimental study to show that BigCloneBench typically includes semantic clone pairs that use the same identifier names..."【4:4†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a novel approach called Linear-Model.
  - **Quote:** "We design an undesirable-by-design approach named Linear-Model, which can achieve high effectiveness on BigCloneBench by utilizing only the identifier name information."【4:19†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the effectiveness of clone detection approaches.
  - **Quote:** "We use the BigCloneBench dataset to answer our RQ1."【4:18†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** Models are trained on BigCloneBench to evaluate their effectiveness.
  - **Quote:** "We conduct experiments on BigCloneBench and OJClone to explore whether and why 'effective' approaches (assessed on BigCloneBench) based on deep learning are not really effective in general."【4:1†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench with 10 functionalities.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench covers 10 functionalities and contains six million tagged true clone pairs..."【4:18†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been modified to create AbsBigCloneBench.
  - **Explanation:** Identifier names are abstracted to create a new dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We abstract a subset of the identifier names in BigCloneBench to better assess the effectiveness of deep learning approaches."【4:9†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** "Table 2 describes the proportion of each clone type in BigCloneBench."【4:14†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been abstracted.
  - **Explanation:** Identifier names are abstracted to create AbsBigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "We abstract a subset of the identifier names in BigCloneBench to produce AbsBigCloneBench."【4:19†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The subset, AbsBigCloneBench, is created by the authors.
  - **Quote:** "We abstract a subset of the identifier names in BigCloneBench to better assess the effectiveness of deep learning approaches."【4:9†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:2†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones suggests that the dataset's reliability as a benchmark is compromised, which could affect the validity of the paper's conclusions.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relying on BigCloneBench may be flawed due to the high rate of false positives in the dataset. This affects the generalizability of the findings, as the models may not perform as well on more accurate datasets. The conclusions about the effectiveness of the Linear-Model and other approaches may need reevaluation in light of this new information.
