# Analysis of Paper 14

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Multi-threshold token-based code clone detection
- **Authors:** Yaroslav Golubev, Viktor Poletansky, Nikita Povarov, Timofey Bryksin
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:2†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a modification to the bag-of-tokens based clone detection method, introducing a multi-threshold search approach to detect more diverse clone pairs without losing precision. The methodology involves conducting multiple searches with different parameter configurations to capture clones of varying sizes and similarities. The study evaluates this approach using two clone detection tools, SourcererCC and CloneWorks, on datasets of different sizes, including BigCloneBench. The results show a significant increase in detected clones, particularly Strongly Type-3 clones, with an improvement in recall from 37.5% to 59.6%. The paper concludes that the proposed method enhances clone detection capabilities and suggests further research into parameter optimization and application to other code representations【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: a smaller dataset consisting of three Java repositories (Mockito, Glide, and RxJava) and a larger dataset from the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. Additionally, BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the recall of the clone detection method【4:14†source】【4:17†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach to clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a modification to bag-of-tokens based clone detection..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new multi-threshold search method for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a modification to bag-of-tokens based clone detection..."【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to evaluate the recall of the proposed method.
  - **Quote:** "We also studied the recall of the method by running CloneWorks with and without it on a popular dataset BigCloneBench..."【4:5†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "We also studied the recall of the method by running CloneWorks with and without it on a popular dataset BigCloneBench..."【4:5†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench but does not mention the specific version used.
  - **Quote:** "We also studied the recall of the method by running CloneWorks with and without it on a popular dataset BigCloneBench..."【4:5†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any filtering or modification of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "We used BigCloneBench evaluation with the same minimum of 19 tokens..."【4:14†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of excluding or specifically including the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** The paper does not provide specific details on WT3/T4【4:14†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as is for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We used BigCloneBench evaluation with the same minimum of 19 tokens..."【4:14†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** The paper does not provide specific details on using subsets from previous work【4:14†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** The paper does not provide specific details on validation【4:14†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The paper does not provide specific details on this citation【4:14†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results, especially if these pairs were included in the evaluation. The paper's claim of increased recall for Strongly Type-3 clones might be affected if these pairs were part of the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology might need reassessment to ensure that the increased recall is not due to false positives. The conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the proposed method could be less reliable if the evaluation included a significant number of non-clone pairs. The generalizability of the findings might be limited if the dataset's integrity is compromised by these non-clone pairs【4:14†source】.
