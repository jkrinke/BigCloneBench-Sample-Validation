# Analysis of Paper 45

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Learning-Based Recursive Aggregation of Abstract Syntax Trees for Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Lutz Büch and Artur Andrzejak
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:11†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper titled "Learning-Based Recursive Aggregation of Abstract Syntax Trees for Code Clone Detection" by Lutz Büch and Artur Andrzejak explores a data-driven approach to code clone detection using recursive neural networks. The study focuses on deriving non-linear aggregation schemes for abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and evaluates the effectiveness of pretrained embeddings in improving clone detection performance. The authors implement a Siamese Network to compare ASTs of Java methods and emphasize the importance of separating training and test data by clone clusters to ensure generalizability. The study concludes that pretrained embeddings significantly enhance the model's performance and that error scaling effectively addresses class imbalance issues【4:11†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically focusing on method-level Java code clones. The dataset is used to obtain ground-truth data for training and testing the proposed clone detection approach【4:15†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is not a systematic literature review or a survey; it is a research study focused on developing and evaluating a novel approach to code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this work, we study several aspects of aggregation schemes for code clone detection based on supervised learning."【4:11†source】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach using recursive neural networks for code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this work, we study several aspects of aggregation schemes for code clone detection based on supervised learning."【4:11†source】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as the ground-truth dataset for evaluating the proposed clone detection approach.
  - **Quote:** "To obtain ground-truth data for training and testing, we turn to the well-known BigCloneBench benchmark dataset."【4:15†source】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the ground truth for training the machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** "To obtain ground-truth data for training and testing, we turn to the well-known BigCloneBench benchmark dataset."【4:15†source】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** The paper refers to "BigCloneBench" without specifying the version【4:15†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was filtered to exclude trees with more than 1000 nodes or a depth greater than 28, and clusters with less than 5 methods after filtering.
  - **Quote:** "We exclude trees with more than 1000 nodes or with a depth greater than 28... This results in 609 methods distributed over 33 clone clusters."【4:15†source】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention the exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** The paper does not provide specific information about the WT3/T4 subset【4:15†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not indicate any changes, extensions, or enrichment to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** The paper focuses on filtering based on node size and depth【4:15†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** The paper describes its own filtering process【4:15†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** The paper relies on the existing ground truth provided by BigCloneBench【4:15†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The references do not include "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"【4:6†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's reliability and the conclusions drawn about the model's performance could be compromised. The generalizability of the results might be affected due to the potential inclusion of incorrect clone pairs, leading to misleading performance metrics.
