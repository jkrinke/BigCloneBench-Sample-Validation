# Analysis of Paper 135

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Active Code Learning: Benchmarking Sample-Efficient Training of Code Models
- **Authors:** Qiang Hu, Maxime Cordy, Mike Papadakis, Yves Le Traon, Yuejun Guo, Xiaofei Xie, Lei Ma
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:7†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a benchmark for active code learning, focusing on the efficient training of code models using active learning techniques. The study evaluates various acquisition functions across multiple code tasks, including classification and non-classification tasks, using pre-trained models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. Key findings indicate that clustering-based methods outperform simple uncertainty methods in binary classification tasks such as clone detection. The study concludes that active code learning is effective for classification tasks but still in its early stages for non-classification tasks. The authors propose using evaluation metrics as distance calculation methods to enhance clustering-based acquisition functions【4:8†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】【4:17†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses several datasets for evaluation, including BigCloneBench for clone detection, JAVA250 for problem classification, Devign for vulnerability detection, and CodeSearchNet for code summarization. The study focuses on a subset of BigCloneBench for computational efficiency【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】【4:6†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates various acquisition functions for active learning in clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We collect acquisition functions (i.e., active learning methods) that can be used for code data from existing studies"【4:4†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as a dataset for clone detection tasks.
  - **Quote:** "In our study, we use the dataset provided by BigCloneBench which contains a large number of Java code clone pairs"【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "In our study, we use the dataset provided by BigCloneBench which contains a large number of Java code clone pairs"【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "In our study, we use the dataset provided by BigCloneBench"【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** A subset of BigCloneBench is used for computational efficiency.
  - **Quote:** "Besides, for the computation friendly, we follow the previous work and only use a subset of data from BigCloneBench"【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention the exclusion or inclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not indicate any changes, extensions, or enrichments to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper follows previous work in using a subset of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "Besides, for the computation friendly, we follow the previous work and only use a subset of data from BigCloneBench"【4:1†135_10.1109_TSE.2024.3376964.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the clone detection results if these pairs were included in the subset used.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subset was included, the methodology's reliability and the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of acquisition functions for clone detection could be compromised. The generalizability of the results might be affected, as the dataset's integrity is crucial for evaluating model performance accurately. However, without specific information on the inclusion of WT3/T4, the exact impact remains uncertain.
