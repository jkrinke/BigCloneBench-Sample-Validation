# Analysis of Paper 163

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Code clone detection based on Doc2vec model and Bagging
- **Authors:** Jun Huang
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:2†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a code clone detection method that combines the Doc2vec model with a bagging ensemble learning approach. The methodology involves converting code into token sequences and abstract syntax tree sequences, then using the Doc2vec model to learn lexical and syntactical information. The bagging algorithm, with support vector machines as base classifiers, is employed to detect code clones. The study evaluates the proposed method against existing models like SourcererCC and tree LSTM, demonstrating superior accuracy and recall on the BigCloneBench dataset. The paper concludes that while the method is effective, improvements are needed for high-level code clone detection【4:2†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses subsets of the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, focusing on Java function-level code clone pairs, which include clone and non-clone tags across different types【4:1†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method for code clone detection rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper proposes a code cloning detection method based on Doc2vec model and bagging"【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method combining Doc2vec and bagging for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "This paper proposes a code cloning detection method based on Doc2vec model and bagging"【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses subsets of BigCloneBench for its experimental dataset.
  - **Quote:** "This paper uses some subsets of bigclonebench [11], a large code clone detection data set, as the experimental data set of this paper"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train the bagging integrated learning classifier.
  - **Quote:** "The code feature learned by the previous module is used as the input of the Bagging Integrated Learning classifier"【4:8†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "This paper uses some subsets of bigclonebench [11]"【4:1†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it uses subsets.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using subsets but does not specify the size.
  - **Quote:** "This paper uses some subsets of bigclonebench"【4:1†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention specific subsets like WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using subsets from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of validation or manual investigation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of the results if these subsets were used, as it would mean the ground truth is unreliable.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subsets were used, the methodology's reliability is compromised, potentially affecting the accuracy and recall results. This could lead to incorrect conclusions about the method's effectiveness and limit the generalizability of the findings. However, without specific information on the subsets used, the exact impact is uncertain.

# Summary

Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 163, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Not specified, Yes, Not specified, Not specified, Not specified, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used, nor does it detail the specific subsets like WT3/T4. Therefore, the impact of the recent findings on WT3/T4 pairs is uncertain but potentially significant if those subsets were used.
