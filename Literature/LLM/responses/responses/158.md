# Analysis of Paper 158

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** CC2Vec: Combining Typed Tokens with Contrastive Learning for Effective Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Shihan Dou, Yueming Wu, Haoxiang Jia, Yuhao Zhou, Yan Liu, Yang Liu
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:0†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces CC2Vec, a novel code encoding method designed to enhance code clone detection, particularly for semantic clones. The methodology involves categorizing tokens by syntactic types and applying self-attention mechanisms to encode them, followed by contrastive learning to handle structural changes in semantic clones. The study evaluates CC2Vec against existing methods using datasets like BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam, demonstrating superior performance in detecting both syntactic and semantic clones. The authors conclude that CC2Vec not only matches but often surpasses the efficiency and effectiveness of current state-of-the-art clone detection systems【4:0†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam. BigCloneBench is highlighted as the largest and widely used dataset for clone detection research【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we introduce CC2Vec, a novel code encoding method..."【4:0†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces CC2Vec, a new method for code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we introduce CC2Vec, a novel code encoding method..."【4:0†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the primary datasets for evaluating CC2Vec.
  - **Quote:** "To check the ability of CC2Vec to detect code clones, we choose BigCloneBench..."【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to pre-train the CC2Vec model.
  - **Quote:** "CC2Vec is only pre-trained on the training dataset, such as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec."【4:17†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions over eight million tagged clone pairs, aligning with the new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench contains about 270,000 non-clone pairs and over eight million tagged clone pairs."【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was balanced by selecting a subset of clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "To balance our dataset, we select almost 270,000 clone pairs from them."【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** WT3/T4 clones were part of the selected subset for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "As a result, there are... 109,914 WT3/T4 clones in our dataset."【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated, but filtering is the only modification mentioned【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper follows a similar approach to previous work for selecting semantic clones.
  - **Quote:** "Similar to previous work [59], for the more challenging semantic clones..."【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:0†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could significantly affect the validity of the results, as WT3/T4 clones were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions, as the reliability of the WT3/T4 subset as ground truth is compromised, potentially leading to overestimated performance metrics【4:3†158_10.1145_3660777.pdf】.
