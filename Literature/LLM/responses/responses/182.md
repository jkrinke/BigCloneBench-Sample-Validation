# Analysis of Paper 182

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** An Extensive Study on Pre-trained Models for Program Understanding and Generation
- **Authors:** Zhengran Zeng, Hanzhuo Tan, Haotian Zhang, Jing Li, Yuqun Zhang, Lingming Zhang
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:16†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper conducts an extensive study on eight open-access pre-trained models for program understanding and generation tasks. It evaluates these models on a large benchmark, CodeXGLUE, across seven representative code tasks to assess their reproducibility and effectiveness compared to domain-specific state-of-the-art techniques. The study also investigates the robustness of these models under adversarial attacks. Key findings include the inability of any single pre-trained model to dominate across all tasks, the significant performance of pre-trained models over non-pre-trained techniques, and the vulnerability of these models to simple adversarial attacks. The paper concludes with practical guidelines for advancing future research in this area【4:12†source】【4:16†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the CodeXGLUE benchmark, which includes datasets such as BigCloneBench for clone detection, POJ-104 for clone detection, Devign for defect detection, Bugs2Fix for code repair, CodeTrans for code translation, CodeSearchNet-AdvTest for code search, and CodeSearchNet-Java for code summarization【4:0†source】【4:7†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study evaluating pre-trained models rather than a literature review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "To this end, we first perform an extensive study of eight open-access pre-trained models over a large benchmark on seven representative code tasks to assess their reproducibility"【4:12†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates existing pre-trained models for program understanding and generation tasks.
  - **Quote:** "We further compare the pre-trained models and domain-specific state-of-the-art techniques for validating pre-trained effectiveness"【4:12†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as part of the CodeXGLUE benchmark for evaluating clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection as a classification problem"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Not mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on filtering or modifying BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not discuss the exclusion or inclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Not mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not indicate any changes, extensions, or enrichments to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Not mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** "Specifically, we adopt BigCloneBench for evaluating clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The citation list does not include "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"【4:2†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the clone detection results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subset was used, the evaluation results might be skewed, affecting the reliability of the conclusions regarding the effectiveness of pre-trained models for clone detection. This could limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios where accurate clone detection is critical. However, since the paper does not specify the use of WT3/T4, the exact impact is uncertain.
