# Analysis of Paper 6

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Stubber: Compiling Source Code into Bytecode without Dependencies for Java Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** André Schäfer, Wolfram Amme, Thomas S. Heinze
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:5†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a tool named STUBBER, designed to compile Java source code into Bytecode without dependencies, facilitating the evaluation of Bytecode-based clone detectors using the BigCloneBench benchmark. The methodology involves transforming Java source files to Bytecode, enabling the application of Bytecode-based clone detectors on benchmarks like BigCloneBench. The study demonstrates that STUBBER can successfully compile over 95% of Java source files in BigCloneBench, covering 92.5% of its validated clone pairs. The authors conclude that STUBBER effectively enables the evaluation of Bytecode-based clone detectors and propose future improvements to support more Java features【4:5†source】【4:7†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically focusing on its application to Bytecode-based clone detectors. The authors mention that they successfully compiled over 95% of the Java source files in BigCloneBench, covering 92.5% of its validated clone pairs【4:5†source】【4:7†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a tool and its evaluation rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we present a method to compile Java source files to Java Bytecode without dependencies."【4:7†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces the STUBBER tool for compiling Java source code into Bytecode.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we present a method to compile Java source files to Java Bytecode without dependencies."【4:7†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the feasibility of using Bytecode-based clone detectors.
  - **Quote:** "Our evaluations show, that using STUBBER, 95% of BigCloneBench Java source files can be successfully compiled, which covers 92.5% of its validated clone pairs."【4:7†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** The focus is on evaluating Bytecode-based clone detectors, not on training models【4:5†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions over 8.5 million known clone pairs, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "Recall of Java clone detectors can be evaluated by comparing detected code clones with the more than 8.5 million manually validated known code clones of BigCloneBench."【4:8†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions compiling 95% of the Java source files, covering 92.5% of the clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "Using STUBBER, we were able to generate Bytecode for over 95% of the 55,499 Java source files of BigCloneBench, covering over 92.5% of the manually validated code clones."【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4 subsets.
  - **Quote:** The paper focuses on the overall compilation success rate and coverage【4:5†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes or extensions to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** The focus is on compiling existing source files【4:5†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset directly.
  - **Quote:** "Using STUBBER, we were able to generate Bytecode for over 95% of the 55,499 Java source files of BigCloneBench."【4:8†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** The focus is on Bytecode compilation and evaluation【4:5†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The references do not include this citation【4:5†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of evaluations using these pairs if they were included.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions regarding the accuracy of Bytecode-based clone detectors if WT3/T4 pairs were part of the evaluated subset. The generalizability of the results might be compromised if these pairs were used without filtering【4:5†source】.

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
