# Analysis of Paper 165

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** What You See is What it Means! Semantic Representation Learning of Code based on Visualization and Transfer Learning
- **Authors:** Patrick Keller, Abdoul Kader Kaboré, Laura Plein, Jacques Klein, Yves Le Traon, and Tegawendé F. Bissyandé
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:17†165_3485135.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces WySiWiM, a novel approach for semantic representation learning of code using visual representations and transfer learning. The methodology involves rendering code as images and using pre-trained image classification models to extract features, which are then used for tasks like code classification, clone detection, and vulnerability prediction. The study evaluates WySiWiM against state-of-the-art methods using datasets such as BigCloneBench and Open Judge, demonstrating competitive performance. The authors conclude that visual representation can effectively capture code semantics, offering a promising direction for future research【4:10†165_3485135.pdf】【4:19†165_3485135.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses several datasets for evaluation, including BigCloneBench (BCB) for clone detection and Open Judge (OJ) for code classification. Additionally, datasets from the KB Project and SySeVR are used for vulnerability prediction【4:0†165_3485135.pdf】【4:19†165_3485135.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "In this article, we propose to investigate another representation learning direction for capturing semantics."【4:10†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces WySiWiM, a new method for semantic representation learning of code.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a novel approach to semantic representation learning of code based on visual representations of code fragments."【4:10†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used for evaluating the clone detection capabilities of WySiWiM.
  - **Quote:** "Experiments for clone detection are done with the BCB, which already has labels on pairs of clones and non-clones."【4:1†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BCB for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "Experiments for clone detection are done with the BCB, which already has labels on pairs of clones and non-clones."【4:1†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The document does not mention whether the old or new version of BCB is used.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a subset of BCB for experiments.
  - **Quote:** "The ASTNN dataset is randomly sampled from the BCB (using a fixed random seed) and hence—more or less—keeps the unbalancing that is present in the BCB itself."【4:7†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no explicit mention of WT3/T4 subsets in the document.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BCB as is for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "Experiments for clone detection are done with the BCB, which already has labels on pairs of clones and non-clones."【4:1†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of BCB that was also used by ASTNN.
  - **Quote:** "For fair comparisons, we run ASTNN and WySiWiM on the same samples of type-4 clones that were used to evaluate ASTNN by Zhang et al."【4:1†165_3485135.pdf】

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation of BCB's ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the clone detection results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subset was used, the methodology's reliability and the conclusions drawn about WySiWiM's performance could be compromised. The generalizability of the results might be affected, as the evaluation would be based on an inaccurate ground truth. However, without explicit mention of WT3/T4 usage, the exact impact remains speculative.

**Note:**  
- **E:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
- **G:** There is no explicit mention of the WT3/T4 subset in the paper.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially impact the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation, but this is speculative without explicit mention of WT3/T4 usage.
