# Analysis of Paper 311

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** MTCD: An Efficient Cloning Detection Technique Based on Method Table
- **Authors:** Fangting Liao, Shun Long, Weiheng Zhu, Wenzhu Chen, Silei Cao, and Xinyi Guan
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:7†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel clone detection approach called MTCD, which operates at the method level by extracting the full method table section from Java class files as a feature for clone detection. This method aims to simplify feature extraction and improve detection efficiency. The study evaluates MTCD using the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrating that it achieves higher F1 scores compared to using only bytecode sequences. The results indicate that MTCD outperforms several established clone detection tools in terms of accuracy and training efficiency, suggesting that the method table is a promising feature for efficient code clone detection【4:7†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which includes Java source code for 43 functions and contains over 8.5 million real clone pairs【4:16†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "We present in this paper a straightforward clone detection approach called MTCD at method level"【4:1†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces MTCD, a new method for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a simple but efficient approach called MTCD"【4:7†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the effectiveness of MTCD.
  - **Quote:** "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of MTCD, we have conducted an empirical experiment with the BigCloneBench benchmark dataset"【4:1†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train classifiers for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "The three feature sequences discussed above are used to train classifiers such as deep neural network(DNN), support vector machine(SVM), logistic regression(LR) and decision tree(DT)"【4:14†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions 43 functions, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench contains Java source code for 43 functions"【4:16†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was split into training and testing parts, with function 4 used for training.
  - **Quote:** "Considering that function 4 contains almost as many clones as all the rest combined do, we split the dataset into two parts and used those in function 4 for training and the other for testing"【4:15†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** WT3/T4 is part of the evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "Table 1. Number of feature sequences of different clone pairs" includes WT3/T4【4:15†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper follows a similar approach to DeepSim for dataset splitting.
  - **Quote:** "as DeepSim has done"【4:15†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:11†311_10.1007_978-3-031-35257-7_19.pdf】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could significantly affect the validity of the results, as WT3/T4 was included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relying on WT3/T4 as valid clone pairs is compromised, potentially affecting the reported F1 scores and the generalizability of the findings. The conclusions about MTCD's effectiveness may need reevaluation considering the high false positive rate in the WT3/T4 subset.
