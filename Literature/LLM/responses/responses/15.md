# Analysis of Paper 15

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** A code clone detection algorithm based on graph convolution network with AST tree edge
- **Authors:** Zhicheng Lu, Ruochen Li, Huamiao Hu, Wen-an Zhou
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:0†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel method for code clone detection using graph convolution networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) to extract code feature vectors from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The study aims to improve the detection of type-4 code clones, which have different syntax but the same functionality. The methodology involves transforming ASTs into graph structures by adding edges, allowing for better feature extraction through graph neural networks. The experimental results, conducted on the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and time efficiency compared to traditional methods. The paper concludes that graph neural networks offer a promising approach for deep code clone detection【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically focusing on type-4 code clones【4:8†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel method rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a method of edging AST, and uses GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) and GAT(Graph Attention Networks) to extract code feature vector"【4:0†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method using graph neural networks for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a method of edging AST, and uses GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) and GAT(Graph Attention Networks) to extract code feature vector"【4:0†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The experiments are conducted on the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "Finally, the experiment is carried out on BigCloneBench data set"【4:0†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train and evaluate the proposed model.
  - **Quote:** "For Java code, we use the BigCloneBench (BCB) data set"【4:8†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench but does not mention the specific version.
  - **Quote:** "For Java code, we use the BigCloneBench (BCB) data set"【4:8†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The study uses a subset focusing on type-4 clones.
  - **Quote:** "Because only type-4 and dissimilar data are used, and the original data set is reduced, the data set can be called c2-RBCB(class2 reduced BigCloneBench)"【4:11†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper focuses on type-4 clones, but does not explicitly mention WT3/T4.
  - **Explanation:** The focus is on type-4 clones, but WT3/T4 is not specifically mentioned.
  - **Quote:** "this study only intends to use the code clone pair of type 4 to do the experiment"【4:8†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering for type-4 clones.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses labeled data provided in previous work.
  - **Quote:** "to use the labeled data provided in Zhang [7]"【4:8†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:2†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The paper's reliance on type-4 clones, which may include WT3/T4 pairs, could be affected by the finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones. This could impact the validity of the results and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the proposed method for type-4 clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions may be compromised if the dataset used for evaluation contains a significant number of mislabeled non-clones. This affects the generalizability of the findings, as the model's performance might not be as robust as reported if evaluated on a more accurate dataset.
