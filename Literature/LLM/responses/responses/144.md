# Analysis of Paper 144

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Research and Implementation of Code Similarity Detection Technology Based on Deep Learning
- **Authors:** Xibao Wu, Wei Zhao, Zhuo Tan, Xinyao Zhang, Wenbai Chen
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:3†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel methodology for code similarity detection using an enhanced Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a Tree-Long Short-Term Memory (Tree-LSTM) neural network. The objective is to improve code security and stability by effectively identifying code clones and vulnerabilities. The methodology involves encoding ASTs into function feature vectors and calculating cosine similarity to determine code similarity. The study compares the proposed method with existing models like Gemini and CCLearner, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The conclusions highlight the method's potential to enhance software security and reduce vulnerability propagation【4:3†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically a subset containing 409,962 clone and non-clone pairs categorized into four types: Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, and Type-4【4:8†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel methodology rather than reviewing existing literature comprehensively.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a novel methodology that leverages an enhanced AST to extract semantic information from the source code"【4:3†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method using Tree-LSTM for code similarity detection.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a novel methodology that leverages an enhanced AST to extract semantic information from the source code"【4:3†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "The BigCloneBench dataset, proposed by Svajlenko et al., consists of 6 million clone pairs... For this project, a subset of the dataset from the official team's GitHub repository was utilized"【4:8†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train and evaluate the Tree-LSTM model.
  - **Quote:** "The BigCloneBench dataset... was utilized, containing a total of 409,962 clone and non-clone pairs"【4:8†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The description matches the old version's characteristics.
  - **Quote:** "The BigCloneBench dataset... consists of 6 million clone pairs, 260,000 non-clone pairs"【4:8†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** A subset of 409,962 pairs was used.
  - **Quote:** "For this project, a subset of the dataset... was utilized, containing a total of 409,962 clone and non-clone pairs"【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No explicit mention of exclusion.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The subset was obtained from the official team's GitHub repository.
  - **Quote:** "For this project, a subset of the dataset from the official team's GitHub repository was utilized"【4:8†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the provided references【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could affect the validity of the results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** This could affect the methodology's accuracy and the generalizability of the conclusions, particularly for Type-4 clones, which are semantically similar but syntactically different【4:8†source】【4:13†source】.
