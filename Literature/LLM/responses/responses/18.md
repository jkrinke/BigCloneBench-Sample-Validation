# Analysis of Paper 18

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** CCLEARNER: A Deep Learning-Based Clone Detection Approach
- **Authors:** Liuqing Li, He Feng, Wenjie Zhuang, Na Meng, and Barbara Ryder
- **Publication Year:** 2017【4:3†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents CCLEARNER, a novel deep learning-based approach for detecting code clones. The objective is to leverage deep learning to improve clone detection by analyzing token usage patterns in source code. The methodology involves training a deep neural network using token-based features extracted from known code clones and non-clones. The study evaluates CCLEARNER against three popular clone detection tools using the BigCloneBench dataset, demonstrating that CCLEARNER achieves high precision and recall with low time cost. The paper concludes that deep learning can effectively detect diverse types of clones and suggests future work to enhance the approach【4:3†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is a large benchmark of real code clones【4:3†source】【4:9†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "We presented CCLEARNER, a deep learning-based clone detection approach"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces CCLEARNER, a new deep learning-based clone detection tool.
  - **Quote:** "We designed and implemented CCLEARNER, the first solely token-based clone detection approach using deep learning"【4:5†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate CCLEARNER's effectiveness.
  - **Quote:** "We evaluated CCLEARNER and three popular clone detection tools using BigCloneBench"【4:9†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to train the deep learning model in CCLEARNER.
  - **Quote:** "To train a binary-class classifier for clone detection, we need feature data for both positive and negative examples of the clone relationship"【4:19†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench but does not mention the specific version used.
  - **Quote:** "We used the BigCloneBench data set in our experiment for a scientific tool comparison"【4:1†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions constructing training and testing datasets from BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "To construct the testing data, we included all source files in the other 9 folders (except Folder #4) of BigCloneBench"【4:8†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, WT3/T4 was included.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates CCLEARNER's recall on WT3/T4 clones.
  - **Quote:** "CCLEARNER effectively detected more T1-ST3 clones, but failed to report many of the MT3 and WT3/4 clones"【4:15†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper constructs its own training and testing datasets from BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "To construct the testing data, we included all source files in the other 9 folders (except Folder #4) of BigCloneBench"【4:8†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper manually examines sampled clone pairs to evaluate precision.
  - **Quote:** "We randomly sampled each tool’s reported clone pairs, and manually examined the method pairs to check whether they were true clones"【4:18†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not mentioned in the references【4:14†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens the claims.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones suggests that the evaluation of CCLEARNER on these types of clones may be flawed, affecting the reported recall and precision.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relying on BigCloneBench's WT3/T4 subset may lead to inaccurate assessments of CCLEARNER's effectiveness. This could affect the generalizability of the conclusions regarding the tool's performance on diverse clone types. The paper's claims about high precision and recall might need reevaluation considering the potential inaccuracies in the ground truth【4:15†source】.

# Summary

Here is the tabular assessment based on the findings:

```
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 18, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Not specified, Yes, No, No, No, Yes, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**
- **E:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench was used.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones potentially weakens the claims regarding CCLEARNER's effectiveness on these clone types.
