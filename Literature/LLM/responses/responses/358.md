# Analysis of Paper 358

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Siamese: scalable and incremental code clone search via multiple code representations
- **Authors:** Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul, Jens Krinke
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:1†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces "Siamese," a novel code clone search tool designed to be scalable, incremental, and capable of handling large codebases. The methodology involves using multiple code representations to improve clone detection accuracy and scalability. Siamese is evaluated against three established datasets, including BigCloneBench, demonstrating high precision and recall in clone detection. The tool is particularly noted for its ability to handle Type-3 clones and its incremental indexing capability, which significantly reduces the time required for index updates. The study concludes that Siamese is effective for large-scale clone detection and can be applied to various software engineering tasks, such as online code clone detection and software license analysis【4:1†source】【4:15†source】【4:17†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses three datasets for evaluation: the OCD dataset, the SOCO dataset, and the BigCloneBench dataset. BigCloneBench is specifically noted for its large scale, containing 8 million manually validated clone pairs【4:12†source】【4:13†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool and evaluates it, rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a novel code clone search technique that is accurate, incremental, and scalable..."【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces the Siamese tool, which is a new code clone search technique.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents a novel code clone search technique that is accurate, incremental, and scalable..."【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is one of the datasets used for evaluating the Siamese tool.
  - **Quote:** "The BigCloneBench data set is one of the largest clone benchmarks available to date."【4:12†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions 8 million clone pairs, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "The benchmark contains 2.9 million files with 8 million manually validated clone pairs..."【4:12†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No specific filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not detail any filtering or modification of the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No exclusion mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates all clone types, including WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** "The results for RQ2 show that Siamese could locate the largest number of moderately Type-3 (MT3) and weakly Type-3 or Type-4 (WT3/T4) clones in BigCloneBench."【4:8†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as provided without changes.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the full dataset as described.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes, partially.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions manual validation for precision scores.
  - **Quote:** "Thus, a manual validation is needed to obtain precision scores."【4:10†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of this citation in the paper.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could affect the validity of the results, especially since the paper highlights the detection of WT3/T4 clones as a strength.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relying on BigCloneBench's WT3/T4 subset may be flawed, affecting the tool's reported precision and recall. This could lead to overestimated performance metrics and affect the generalizability of the conclusions regarding the tool's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

**Note:**  
- **J:** The paper mentions manual validation for precision scores, which implies some level of investigation into the ground truth.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could potentially weaken the claims regarding the tool's effectiveness in detecting WT3/T4 clones.
