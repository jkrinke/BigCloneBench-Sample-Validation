# Analysis of Paper 74

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Interface Driven Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Md Rakib Hossain Misu, Kazi Sakib
- **Publication Year:** 2017【4:1†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel technique called Interface Driven Code Clone Detection (IDCCD), which identifies code clones by leveraging method interface similarities, such as method names, return types, and parameter types. The methodology involves tokenizing method blocks, extracting interface information, and using an inverted index for clone detection. The study evaluates IDCCD using the BigCloneEval framework, which includes the BigCloneBench dataset, and compares its performance against other state-of-the-art tools. The results indicate that IDCCD achieves competitive recall and precision with lower complexity. The paper concludes that interface information is a viable approach for clone detection and suggests future work on execution time and scalability【4:1†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】【4:4†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, which is part of the BigCloneEval framework. This dataset includes various types of clones such as Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, and Type-4【4:3†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel technique rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, a light weight Interface Driven Code Clone Detection (IDCCD) technique is proposed."【4:5†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces the IDCCD technique for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, a light weight Interface Driven Code Clone Detection (IDCCD) technique is proposed."【4:5†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as part of the BigCloneEval framework for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "To evaluate IDCCD performance, recall and precision are calculated using a clone evaluation framework namely BigCloneEval. It contains a standard clone benchmark called BigCloneBench."【4:6†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to BigCloneBench but does not specify whether it is the old or new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench contains manually validated clone pairs."【4:6†74_10.1109_APSEC.2017.97.pdf】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention filtering or modifying the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of excluding or specifically addressing the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as provided without modifications.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset directly.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** If 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones, this could affect the validity of the results, especially if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology might be affected if the evaluation relied heavily on these pairs, leading to inaccurate recall and precision metrics. The conclusions about the effectiveness of IDCCD could be overstated if based on flawed data. The generalizability of the findings might be limited if the dataset's integrity is compromised.
