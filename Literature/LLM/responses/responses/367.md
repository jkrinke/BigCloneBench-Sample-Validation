# Analysis of Paper 367

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Two-Pass Technique for Clone Detection and Type Classification Using Tree-Based Convolution Neural Network
- **Authors:** Young-Bin Jo, Jihyun Lee, and Cheol-Jung Yoo
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:5†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a novel two-pass technique for clone detection and type classification using a Tree-Based Convolutional Neural Network (TBCNN). The objective is to improve the detection and classification of code clones, particularly for types T3 and T4, which are more challenging to identify. The methodology involves a first pass for clone detection and a second pass for clone type classification, both utilizing TBCNN to extract features from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The study uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, achieving high precision and recall rates for clone detection and moderate success in clone type classification. The authors conclude that their approach is effective and suggest future improvements in handling subtle AST differences【4:5†source】【4:1†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for training and testing their model. It is described as a real-world benchmark containing over 6 million tagged clone pairs across 43 functionalities【4:11†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel technique rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "This paper proposes a two-pass clone classification technique that uses a tree-based convolution neural network (TBCNN)..."【4:5†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new two-pass technique for clone detection and classification.
  - **Quote:** "This paper proposes a two-pass clone classification technique that uses a tree-based convolution neural network (TBCNN)..."【4:5†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used for training and testing the model.
  - **Quote:** "We used BigCloneBench for training and testing our model."【4:11†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used for both training and testing the model.
  - **Quote:** "We used BigCloneBench for training and testing our model."【4:11†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions 43 functionalities, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench [15] is a real-world benchmark that contains over 6,000,000 tagged clone pairs across 43 functionalities..."【4:11†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No specific filtering or modification is mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not detail any filtering or modification of the dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench divides T3 and T4 clones into four categories: Very-Strongly Type 3 (VST3), Strongly Type 3 (ST3), Moderately Type 3 (MT3), and Weakly Type 3+4 (WT3/4)."【4:11†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the dataset as is for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the dataset's ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could affect the validity of the paper's results, particularly in clone type classification accuracy.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relies on BigCloneBench as a ground truth, and if a significant portion of the dataset is incorrect, it could lead to misleading conclusions about the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The generalizability of the results may be compromised if the dataset's inaccuracies are not addressed.
