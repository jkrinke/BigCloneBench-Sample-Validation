# Analysis of Paper 210

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** CCGraph: A PDG-Based Code Clone Detector with Approximate Graph Matching
- **Authors:** Yue Zou, Bihuan Ban, Yinxing Xue, Yun Xu
- **Publication Year:** 2020【4:1†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces a novel code clone detection tool named CCGraph, which utilizes Program Dependency Graphs (PDGs) and an approximate graph matching algorithm based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph kernel. The objective is to improve the detection of PDG-based clones, which are often missed by existing tools due to their reliance on exact graph matching. The methodology involves preprocessing PDGs to optimize their structure and applying a two-stage filtering strategy to reduce candidate clone pairs. The key findings indicate that CCGraph achieves higher accuracy, recall, and F1-score compared to state-of-the-art tools, while also being more efficient. The study concludes that CCGraph can detect more semantic clones and is suitable for integration into software development and management systems【4:0†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper evaluates CCGraph using various datasets, including artificial datasets and real-world datasets. For Java code, the tool is compared against Oreo, a deep learning-based clone detector, using Java datasets. The paper does not explicitly mention using BigCloneBench for evaluation【4:8†source】【4:15†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel PDG-based code clone detector, CCGraph, that uses graph kernels"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new clone detection tool, CCGraph.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel PDG-based code clone detector, CCGraph"【4:1†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench in its evaluation.
  - **Quote:** "We introduce the datasets used in experiments in detail and explain the reasons for choosing these datasets"【4:8†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not involve training a machine learning model using BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not applicable.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not use BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Not applicable.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not use BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not applicable.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not use BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Not applicable.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not use BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset from previous work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not involve BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** Since the paper does not use BigCloneBench, the finding about WT3/T4 pairs does not impact its claims.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:**
  - The recent finding about WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench does not affect the methodology, conclusions, or generalizability of this paper, as it does not rely on BigCloneBench for its evaluation or claims.
