# Analysis of Paper 109

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** ZC<sup>3</sup>: Zero-Shot Cross-Language Code Clone Detection
- **Authors:** Jia Li, Fang Liu, Chongyang Tao, Zhi Jin, Ge Li
- **Publication Year:** 2023【4:1†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces ZC<sup>3</sup>, a novel approach for zero-shot cross-language code clone detection, which does not rely on parallel multilingual data. The methodology involves using CodeBERT to create an isomorphic representation space through contrastive snippet prediction, domain-aware learning, and cycle consistency learning. The study evaluates ZC<sup>3</sup> on four cross-language datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. The findings suggest that ZC<sup>3</sup> effectively aligns representations across languages, enhancing clone detection capabilities without requiring labeled cross-language data【4:1†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper evaluates ZC<sup>3</sup> using four cross-language datasets: CSNCC, CodeJam, AtCoder, and XLCoST. Additionally, it uses two monolingual datasets, POJ-104 and BigCloneBench, to assess monolingual clone detection performance【4:4†source】【4:17†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose a novel method named ZC3 for Zero-shot Cross-language Code Clone detection"【4:1†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces ZC<sup>3</sup>, a new method for clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a novel zero-shot cross-language clone detection method dubbed ZC3"【4:5†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used to evaluate monolingual clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We further introduce two monolingual clone detection datasets, i.e., the BigCloneBench dataset and the POJ-104 dataset"【4:17†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for training CodeBERTFT.
  - **Quote:** "We train CodeBERT on the training set of POJ-104 and BigCloneBench, respectively, and name it CodeBERTFT"【4:15†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify the version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using a filtered version but does not specify old or new.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench was first proposed by Svajlenko et al. and we use the filtered version provided by Wang et al."【4:17†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a filtered version of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "We use the filtered version provided by Wang et al."【4:17†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** The paper does not specify.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of WT3/T4 in the context of filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a filtered version provided by Wang et al.
  - **Quote:** "We use the filtered version provided by Wang et al."【4:17†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** If 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones, this could affect the validity of results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact:** The methodology and conclusions might be affected if the WT3/T4 subset was used without filtering, as it could lead to inaccurate performance metrics. The generalizability of the findings could be compromised if the dataset's integrity is questioned. However, since the paper uses a filtered version, the impact depends on whether WT3/T4 was part of the filtered subset【4:17†source】.

# Summary

Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 109, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Not specified, Yes, Not specified, No, Yes, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- **E:** The paper does not specify whether the old or new version of BigCloneBench is used.
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded or included in the filtered version.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation without proper filtering. However, the impact is uncertain due to the lack of specific information on the inclusion of WT3/T4 in the filtered dataset used.
