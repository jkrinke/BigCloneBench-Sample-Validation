# Analysis of Paper 65

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** A Large-Gap Clone Detection Approach Using Sequence Alignment via Dynamic Parameter Optimization
- **Authors:** Jinze Liu, Tao Wang, Chenhui Feng, Huaimin Wang, and Dongsheng Li
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:4†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents a novel approach for detecting large-gap code clones by transforming the problem into a sequence alignment task using the Smith-Waterman algorithm with dynamic parameter optimization. The study aims to improve the detection of large-gap clones, which are prevalent in software systems but challenging to identify due to numerous edits. The methodology involves combining code fingerprinting with sequence alignment and evaluating the approach on five large-scale Java projects and over 10 million lines of code. Key findings indicate that the proposed method effectively detects large-gap clones and performs competitively with existing tools for general clone detection. The paper concludes that the approach is promising for improving clone detection accuracy and has potential applications in software maintenance and code copyright authentication【4:4†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluating general clone detection performance. It compares the proposed approach with seven advanced detection tools using this dataset【4:11†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature comprehensively.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we have presented a dynamic parameter based sequence alignment algorithm and combined it with code fingerprint for detecting large-gap clones"【4:6†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces a new method for detecting large-gap clones using sequence alignment.
  - **Quote:** "We transform the code clone detection problem into a biological sequence alignment question and propose a novel approach"【4:9†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the general clone detection performance of the proposed approach.
  - **Quote:** "We choose the widely used evaluation framework named BigCloneEval to carry on this experiments. It is a framework for clone detection recall evaluation using BigCloneBench"【4:11†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to over eight million validated clones, which corresponds to the new version of BigCloneBench.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench provides a collection of over eight million validated clones"【4:11†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention filtering or modifying the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the recall of MT3 and WT3 clones, indicating these subsets were included.
  - **Quote:** "Despite this, BigCloneEval reports that the recall of MT3 and WT3 clones of these partial results rise to 24% and 3%, respectively"【4:12†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as is for evaluation purposes.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the full BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, especially since the paper evaluates the recall of MT3 and WT3 clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting WT3 clones may be compromised. The generalizability of the results is also affected, as the dataset's reliability is questioned. This could lead to overestimating the approach's performance in real-world scenarios where accurate clone detection is critical【4:12†source】.
