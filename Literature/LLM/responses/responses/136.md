# Analysis of Paper 136

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** A Blockchain-Based Copyright Management Scheme for Open-Source Software and Hardware
- **Authors:** Yuhang Jin, Li Ling
- **Publication Year:** 2025【4:6†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper proposes a blockchain-based copyright management scheme for open-source software and hardware projects. It introduces an originality detection algorithm based on community detection to extract variable granularity data digests from original files, which are then stored on a decentralized blockchain. The scheme aims to provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant, and transparent method for copyright verification and protection, addressing challenges in copyright ownership and infringement in open-source environments. The study concludes that the proposed scheme effectively enhances copyright protection and originality detection, with future work aimed at improving the model's efficiency and applicability【4:16†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two test datasets for evaluation: one written in C language sourced from the "tiny-httpd" project, and the other in Java sourced from the BigCloneBench dataset【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】.

  - **Quote:** "We perform originality detection on the two software code test datasets with different parameters."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify which version of BigCloneBench is used.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide details on filtering or modifying the BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention the exclusion or inclusion of the WT3/T4 subset.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not discuss any changes, extensions, or enrichment of the BigCloneBench ground truth.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Not specified.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using a subset created by previous work.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** "The code in the second test dataset is written in Java and is sourced from the BigCloneBench open-source code clone dataset."【4:5†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** The reference list does not include "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning."【4:6†136_10.26599_TST.2023.9010112.pdf】

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were used in the evaluation. However, the paper does not specify whether WT3/T4 was included or excluded.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were included, the methodology's reliability and the conclusions drawn from the evaluation using BigCloneBench could be compromised. This would affect the generalizability of the originality detection algorithm's effectiveness as reported in the paper.
