# Analysis of Paper 44

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** The title of the paper is not explicitly mentioned in the snippets provided. However, it is associated with the DOI 10.1109/ASE.2019.00011.
- **Authors:** The authors of the paper are not explicitly mentioned in the snippets provided.
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:18†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper investigates the generalizability of code token embeddings, specifically those learned by code2vec, for various downstream software engineering tasks. The study evaluates the performance of these embeddings on tasks such as code comment generation, code authorship identification, and code clone detection, using models augmented with code embeddings compared to simpler baseline models. The findings suggest that code2vec's token embeddings do not significantly enhance model performance across these tasks, highlighting the need for further research into more generalizable code embedding models【4:18†source】【4:14†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench and OJClone. BigCloneBench is used as a benchmark of known clones in the IJaDataset, while OJClone is a dataset of programming problems with student submissions【4:2†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study evaluating the generalizability of code embeddings.
  - **Quote:** "Our study aims to answer a single research question: Are embeddings of source code tokens generalizable for use in tasks that they are not trained for?"【4:14†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates the performance of existing models augmented with code embeddings.
  - **Quote:** "We try to augment these models using embeddings of source code tokens"【4:17†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as one of the datasets for evaluating code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We use 2 datasets for this task. Firstly, we use the standard BigCloneBench"【4:2†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "In our experiments on BigCloneBench, we only consider clones that are greater than 6 lines and 50 tokens"【4:5†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions over 8 million validated code clones, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "In BigCloneBench, a code fragment is a single method and there are over 8 million validated code clones in the dataset"【4:2†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper considers clones greater than 6 lines and 50 tokens.
  - **Quote:** "In our experiments on BigCloneBench, we only consider clones that are greater than 6 lines and 50 tokens"【4:5†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not provide specific information about excluding WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the standard BigCloneBench without modifications beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** "We use 2 datasets for this task. Firstly, we use the standard BigCloneBench"【4:2†source】.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the standard BigCloneBench dataset.
  - **Quote:** "We use 2 datasets for this task. Firstly, we use the standard BigCloneBench"【4:2†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any validation or manual investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially weakens.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could affect the validity of the recall results reported in the paper, especially for Type-3 and Type-4 clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relying on BigCloneBench's ground truth for evaluation might be compromised, affecting the conclusions about the effectiveness of code embeddings in detecting clones. The generalizability of the findings could be questioned if the dataset's integrity is compromised.

**Note:**  
- **B:** The paper evaluates existing approaches rather than presenting a novel one.
- **F:** The dataset was filtered to include only clones greater than 6 lines and 50 tokens.
- **G:** The exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset is not specified in the paper.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones potentially weakens the paper's claims regarding clone detection accuracy.
