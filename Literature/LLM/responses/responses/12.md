# Analysis of Paper 12

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Clone-Seeker: Effective Code Clone Search Using Annotations
- **Authors:** Muhammad Hammad, Önder Babur, Hamid Abdul Basit, and Mark van den Brand
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:3†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces Clone-Seeker, a novel approach for code clone search that utilizes clone class features to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The methodology involves generating metadata for each code clone in the form of a natural language document, which includes identifiers and keywords indicating the semantics of the code clone. The study evaluates Clone-Seeker using both code and natural language queries on the BigCloneBench and Project CodeNet datasets. Key findings indicate that Clone-Seeker, particularly with manual annotation, outperforms other variants in terms of recall and precision, especially for Type-4 clones. The paper concludes that Clone-Seeker is effective and generalizable, with potential for further improvement through enhanced annotation strategies【4:3†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses two datasets for evaluation: BigCloneBench and Project CodeNet. BigCloneBench is the primary dataset used for evaluating the effectiveness of Clone-Seeker in retrieving code clones using both code and natural language queries【4:1†source】【4:5†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a novel approach called Clone-Seeker that focuses on utilizing clone class features in retrieving code clones"【4:3†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces Clone-Seeker, a new method for code clone search.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a novel approach called Clone-Seeker that focuses on utilizing clone class features in retrieving code clones"【4:3†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used as the primary dataset for evaluating Clone-Seeker.
  - **Quote:** "Our primary evaluation is based on the BigCloneBench dataset"【4:1†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training a machine learning model.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated in the text.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using the version with over 8 million clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench is the largest clone benchmark dataset, with over 8 million manually validated clone method pairs"【4:15†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions filtering based on clone method length and token count.
  - **Quote:** "We choose clone methods having at least 6 lines and 50 tokens in length"【4:14†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was not excluded.
  - **Explanation:** The paper evaluates WT3/T4 clones and reports recall for them.
  - **Quote:** "With 59% recall for semantic clones (WT3/T4), Clone-Seeker (Manual) achieves the best performance score"【4:14†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes to the ground truth beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated in the text.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses configurations and subsets similar to previous studies.
  - **Quote:** "We reproduce the experiments performed in [2], [37], [74]"【4:14†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly stated in the text.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the references【4:7†source】【4:9†source】.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes, it potentially weakens claims regarding the effectiveness of Clone-Seeker for WT3/T4 clones.
  - **Explanation:** Since 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones, the reported recall for these types may be misleading.
  - **Impact:** This affects the methodology and conclusions related to the effectiveness of Clone-Seeker for semantic clones, potentially reducing the generalizability of the results【4:14†source】.

**Note:**  
- **F:** The ground truth of BigCloneBench was filtered based on clone method length and token count.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones potentially weakens the claims regarding the effectiveness of Clone-Seeker for these types of clones.
