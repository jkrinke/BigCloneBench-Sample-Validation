# Analysis of Paper 413

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Clone-advisor: recommending code tokens and clone methods with deep learning and information retrieval
- **Authors:** Muhammad Hammad, Önder Babur, Hamid Abdul Basit, Mark van den Brand
- **Publication Year:** 2021【4:2†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper presents "Clone-Advisor," a novel approach that combines deep learning and information retrieval to recommend code clones. The methodology builds on a previous model, DeepClone, which predicts code tokens and clone methods. Clone-Advisor enhances this by recommending real clone methods that closely match the predicted ones, thus improving the accuracy of clone method recommendations. The study evaluates the effectiveness of Clone-Advisor using the BigCloneBench dataset, focusing on its ability to match clone functionalities and exact matches with ground truth. The results demonstrate significant improvements in clone method recommendations, with high accuracy in functionality matches【4:2†source】【4:8†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the BigCloneBench dataset for evaluation, specifically focusing on its 43 functionalities. It also mentions using a reduced version of IJaDataset, which contains source files with clone method references from BigCloneBench【4:5†source】【4:7†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel approach rather than reviewing existing literature systematically.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper we have discussed and refined our previous work on DeepClone in much more detail"【4:2†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces Clone-Advisor, a new method for recommending code clones.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a novel approach called Clone-Advisor"【4:2†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench to evaluate the effectiveness of Clone-Advisor.
  - **Quote:** "We have introduced the fundamental techniques and evaluated them with respect to multiple aspects by focusing on BigCloneBench dataset"【4:7†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used to train the DeepClone model, which is part of the Clone-Advisor methodology.
  - **Quote:** "The training set is used to train DeepClone language model"【4:5†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions using BigCloneBench with 43 functionalities.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench contains clones corresponding to 43 distinct functionalities"【4:5†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a reduced version of IJaDataset containing only relevant source files.
  - **Quote:** "We use a reduced version of IJaDataset containing only the source files whose clone method references exist in BigCloneBench"【4:5†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a reduced version of IJaDataset as provided by previous work.
  - **Quote:** "Svajlenko et al. (2014) provide a reduced version of IJaDataset"【4:5†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any manual validation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could impact the validity of the paper's results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were part of the evaluation, the methodology's accuracy claims might be overstated, affecting the generalizability of the results. The paper's conclusions about the effectiveness of Clone-Advisor could be less reliable if based on incorrect ground truth data. However, without explicit mention of WT3/T4, the exact impact is uncertain.

**Note:**  
- **G:** The paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- **L:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these pairs were included in the evaluation. However, the exact impact is uncertain without explicit mention of WT3/T4.
