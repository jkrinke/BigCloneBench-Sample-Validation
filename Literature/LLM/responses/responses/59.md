# Analysis of Paper 59

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** On Precision of Code Clone Detection Tools
- **Authors:** Farima Farmahinifarahani, Vaibhav Saini, Di Yang, Hitesh Sajnani, and Cristina V. Lopes
- **Publication Year:** 2019【4:9†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper titled "On Precision of Code Clone Detection Tools" aims to evaluate the precision of eight code clone detection tools through systematic experiments. The study employs both undifferentiated and type-based precision measurements, involving manual validation of 12,800 clone pairs by three judges. The key findings reveal significant differences in tool performance across different clone types, emphasizing the importance of type-based precision evaluation. The study concludes that while detection of simpler clone types (I and II) is largely solved, more complex types (III and IV) require further research. The authors advocate for the inclusion of clone type information in precision measurements to enhance the evaluation of clone detection tools【4:9†source】【4:6†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the IJaDataset-2.0, a large Java repository, for evaluating the precision of clone detection tools. This dataset is part of the BigCloneEval framework, which is used for conducting recall studies on clone detectors【4:16†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper is an empirical study focused on evaluating the precision of clone detection tools.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents systematic experiments to evaluate precision of eight code clone detection tools"【4:9†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Evaluate existing approaches.
  - **Explanation:** The study evaluates the precision of existing clone detection tools.
  - **Quote:** "This paper presents systematic experiments to evaluate precision of eight code clone detection tools"【4:9†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as part of the BigCloneEval framework for recall studies.
  - **Quote:** "The dataset of this study is the dataset curated for BigCloneEval, a tool for conducting recall studies on clone detectors"【4:16†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention using BigCloneBench for training machine learning models.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** New version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper refers to the dataset having more than 8 million clone pairs, which corresponds to the new version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench has more than 8 million clone pairs tagged"【4:18†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions removing unparseable code fragments from the dataset.
  - **Quote:** "Some of the clone pairs reported by the tools included code fragments that were not parseable; hence, we removed those pairs from our study"【4:17†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No, it was included.
  - **Explanation:** The paper includes WT3/T4 in its type-based precision analysis.
  - **Quote:** "The definition provided for clone types does not specify the minimum syntactic similarity for a clone pair to be classified as a Type III clone... Weakly Type III, also identified as Type IV, (WT3/4)"【4:10†source】.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes or extensions to the ground truth beyond filtering unparseable pairs.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset used is part of BigCloneEval, which is based on previous work.
  - **Quote:** "The dataset of this study is the dataset curated for BigCloneEval"【4:16†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper involves manual validation of clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "Three judges independently reviewed 12,800 clone pairs to compute the undifferentiated and type-based precision of these tools"【4:9†source】.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of this citation in the paper.
  - **Quote:** Not applicable.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could significantly impact the validity of the paper's results, particularly the precision measurements for Type III clones.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** The methodology relies on the accuracy of the ground truth in BigCloneBench. If a large portion of the WT3/T4 pairs are incorrectly labeled, the precision results for tools detecting these types of clones may be skewed. This could lead to incorrect conclusions about the effectiveness of the tools and affect the generalizability of the study's findings. The study's emphasis on type-based precision evaluation would be undermined if the ground truth is unreliable for certain clone types【4:10†source】【4:14†source】.
