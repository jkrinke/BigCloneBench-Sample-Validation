# Analysis of Paper 53

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Modeling Functional Similarity in Source Code With Graph-Based Siamese Networks
- **Authors:** Nikita Mehrotra, Navdha Agarwal, Piyush Gupta, Saket Anand, David Lo, and Rahul Purandare
- **Publication Year:** 2022【4:15†source】

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces HOLMES, a novel tool for detecting semantic code clones using program dependency graphs (PDGs) and graph-based neural networks. The authors aim to improve the detection of semantic clones by leveraging both syntactic and semantic information from source code. HOLMES employs a graph-based deep neural network to learn program representations, focusing on control and data dependencies. The tool was evaluated against state-of-the-art clone detection tools on various datasets, demonstrating superior performance in detecting semantic clones. The study concludes that HOLMES effectively generalizes to unseen datasets and outperforms existing methods【4:15†source】【4:2†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses the following datasets for evaluation:
- **Google Code Jam (GCJ):** A dataset from a programming competition with functionally similar solutions.
- **SeSaMe Dataset:** Consists of semantically similar method pairs from open-source Java repositories.
- **BigCloneBench (BCB):** Used for evaluating code clone detection, specifically the initial version covering ten functionalities【4:16†source】【4:18†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel tool and empirical evaluation rather than a literature review or survey.
  - **Quote:** "We have developed a prototype tool HOLMES, based on our novel approach and empirically evaluated it on popular code clone benchmarks."【4:15†source】

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces HOLMES, a new tool for semantic code clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We have proposed a novel code clone detection tool HOLMES."【4:19†source】

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench as one of the datasets for evaluating HOLMES.
  - **Quote:** "We used datasets from GCJ and BCB."【4:9†source】

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses BigCloneBench for training and validation purposes.
  - **Quote:** "For the BCB dataset, we used the same code fragments from the related work."【4:9†source】

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the initial version covering ten functionalities.
  - **Quote:** "Some recent code clone detection tools... have used the initial version of the BCB covering ten functionalities for their experiments."【4:18†source】

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses a subset of the BCB dataset for training and validation.
  - **Quote:** "We used around 700K code pairs for training. For validation and testing, we used 300K code clone pairs each."【4:9†source】

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** No explicit mention of exclusion.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4 subsets.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes or extensions to the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The paper uses the same code fragments from related work.
  - **Quote:** "For the BCB dataset, we used the same code fragments from the related work."【4:9†source】

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of BigCloneBench’s ground truth.
  - **Quote:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** Not found in the provided excerpts.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The recent finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the results if these pairs were included in the evaluation.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If WT3/T4 pairs were used in the evaluation, the accuracy and effectiveness of HOLMES in detecting semantic clones might be overstated. This could affect the generalizability of the conclusions, as the tool's performance might not be as robust as reported if evaluated on a flawed dataset. The methodology might need to be revisited to ensure that the evaluation is based on accurate ground truth data.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 53, No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, Yes, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- For question G, the paper does not explicitly mention the exclusion of the WT3/T4 subset, hence "Not specified" is used.
- For question L, the term "Potentially" is used because the impact of the WT3/T4 finding depends on whether these pairs were included in the evaluation, which is not specified in the paper.
