# Analysis of Paper 174

### Task 1: Extract Key Metadata

- **Title:** Effective Hard Negative Mining for Contrastive Learning-based Code Search
- **Authors:** Ye Fan, Chuanyi Li, Jidong Ge, Liguo Huang, and Bin Luo
- **Publication Year:** 2024【4:1†source】.

### Task 2: Summarize the Paper

The paper introduces CoCoHaNeRe, a novel framework for code search that leverages contrastive learning with hard negative mining to improve the semantic understanding of code snippets. The methodology involves using a memory bank to retrieve hard negative examples, which are then used to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between semantically similar codes. The study evaluates CoCoHaNeRe on datasets like CodeSearchNet and XLCoST, demonstrating superior performance over existing models in code search, clone detection, and code question answering tasks. The authors conclude that CoCoHaNeRe effectively improves code retrieval tasks by learning high-order semantic differences【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Task 3: Extract Dataset Usage

The paper uses several datasets for evaluation, including CodeSearchNet, XLCoST, CoSQA, POJ-104, and BigCloneBench. These datasets are employed to assess the performance of CoCoHaNeRe across various code understanding tasks such as code search, clone detection, and code question answering【4:3†source】【4:12†source】.

### Task 4: Analyze BigCloneBench Usage

- **Q A:** Is the paper a systematic literature review (SLR) or a survey?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper presents a novel framework rather than reviewing existing literature.
  - **Quote:** "In this paper, we propose CoCoHaNeRe, a Code search framework augmented by Contrastive learning with differentiable Hard Negative samples Retrieval"【4:0†source】.

- **Q B:** Does the paper present a novel clone detection or clone search approach or evaluate existing approaches?
  - **A:** Yes, it presents a novel approach.
  - **Explanation:** The paper introduces CoCoHaNeRe, a new framework for code search and clone detection.
  - **Quote:** "We propose a new contrastive learning framework CoCoHaNeRe for code search and code similarity learning with hard negative mining"【4:0†source】.

- **Q C:** Does the paper use BigCloneBench for evaluation?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** BigCloneBench is used for evaluating the clone detection task.
  - **Quote:** "Clone detection includes two subtasks... We use the BigCloneBench dataset for this subtask"【4:12†source】.

- **Q D:** Is BigCloneBench used as ground truth for training a machine learning approach?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset is used for evaluation, not for training.
  - **Quote:** "We use the BigCloneBench dataset for this subtask"【4:12†source】.

- **Q E:** Which version of BigCloneBench (old/new) has been used?
  - **A:** Old version.
  - **Explanation:** The paper mentions the dataset contains over 6,000,000 true clone pairs from 10 functionalities, which corresponds to the old version.
  - **Quote:** "BigCloneBench is a large code clone benchmark that contains over 6,000,000 true clone pairs and 260,000 false clone pairs from 10 different functionalities"【4:12†source】.

- **Q F:** Has the ground truth of BigCloneBench been filtered/modified? If so, what is the size of the subset used?
  - **A:** Yes, it has been filtered.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset was filtered by discarding code fragments without any tagged true or false clone pairs.
  - **Quote:** "The dataset provided by Wang et al. is filtered by discarding code fragments without any tagged true or false clone pairs, leaving it with 9,134 Java code fragments"【4:12†source】.

- **Q G:** Has the WT3/T4 subset been excluded from evaluation? If filtered, was WT3/T4 part of the subset?
  - **A:** Not explicitly mentioned.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not specify the exclusion of WT3/T4 subsets.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q H:** Ignoring filtering, has the ground truth otherwise been changed, extended, or enriched?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not mention any changes beyond filtering.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q I:** Has the paper used a subset created by previous work?
  - **A:** Yes.
  - **Explanation:** The dataset used is filtered as per previous work by Wang et al.
  - **Quote:** "The dataset provided by Wang et al. is filtered by discarding code fragments without any tagged true or false clone pairs"【4:12†source】.

- **Q J:** Has the paper validated or manually investigated BigCloneBench’s ground truth?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** There is no mention of manual validation or investigation of the ground truth.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

- **Q K:** Does the paper cite "BigCloneBench Considered Harmful for Machine Learning"?
  - **A:** No.
  - **Explanation:** The paper does not cite this work.
  - **Quote:** No specific quote available.

### Task 5: Critical Analysis – Impact of New Findings

- **Q L:** Does this finding weaken or invalidate any claims in the paper?
  - **A:** Potentially, yes.
  - **Explanation:** The finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs in BigCloneBench are not clones could impact the validity of the evaluation results if these subsets were included.
  - **Impact on Methodology, Conclusions, or Generalizability:** If the WT3/T4 subsets were included in the evaluation, the reliability of the results could be compromised, affecting the generalizability of the findings. The methodology might need to be revisited to ensure that the evaluation metrics accurately reflect the true performance of the model.

# Summary

```plaintext
Question, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Paper 174, No, Yes, Yes, No, Old, Yes, Not specified, No, Yes, No, No, Potentially
```

**Note:**  
- For question G, the paper does not specify whether the WT3/T4 subset was excluded from evaluation.
- For question L, the finding that 93.35% of WT3/T4 pairs are not clones could potentially weaken the paper's claims if these subsets were included in the evaluation.
